[ML]
[Beat]Are you listening?[AN]
[R]
Hm?[AN]
[ML]
Why call me to your quarters for a report[N]
if you're just going to space out?[AN]
[R]
Sorry, Rahel. I've been thinking[N]
about other matters, recently.[AN]
A lot on the mind when you get older.[AN]
[ML]
Sorry, I don't care. Anyway,[N]
the repairs are about done.[AN]
The ship is fully functional.[N]
Just needs some bells and whistles.[AN]
[R]
Good work. I took a look around,[N]
and it looks better than it did before.[AN]
You really are worth your weight in gold.[AN]
[ML]
I don't really weigh much[Beat] Besides,[N]
that level of work is easy to beat.[AN]
I'm not sure who the shipwright was,[N]
but they did a terrible job with it.[AN]
I would've been done in half the time[N]
without so many odd design choices.[AN]
[R]
It was a budget option, I'll admit.[AN]
But since you did such a good job,[N]
I think you deserve a bonus for it.[AN]
You can go buy some confections,[N]
or whatever it is kids want.[AN]
Maybe Razvan can tell you about turr[รณ]n.[A]
[ML]
I'll take the gold, but listen up.[AN]
Do not treat me like a child,[N]
or I'll put a hole in your ship's hull.[AN][X]

[R][LoadLuaHatless]
[FFR][LoadOrlando]
[FFR][MoFR]
[FR]
Bit of a sore point, eh lass?[AN]
Try not to take it so personal.[AN]
Coming from old codgers like us,[N]
Lua is almost giving you a compliment![AN]
[R]
[OQ]Us[CQ]? Compared to me,[N]
you're a fossil.[AN]
[ML]
I agree with the captain.[AN]
Besides, it's pretty clear you both[N]
don't take me seriously at all.[AN]
[FR]
It's more like[Beat] I remember my youth,[N]
and the worries that came with it.[AN]
But looking back at them now,[N]
so many of them were foolish.[AN]
[ML]
Is that why you act the fool now?[N]
Making up for lost time, gramps?[AN]
[FR]
Heh, maybe so. In any case,[N]
you have plenty of time to grow up.[AN]
There's no need to rush it, Rahel.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat] [Beat][A][X]

[FFL]
Neiiiiiiigh![A]
[ML]
Huh? What's wrong, girl?[N]
Why are you shaking?[AN]
[R]
Is that[Beat] a horse?[AN]
[ML]
Yes, her name's Daisy.[AN]
I send her out to graze[N]
while I work, usually[Beat][AN]
But she never does this.[N]
She's trembling, but why?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]I'd wager the answer[N]
is nothing good, Lua.[AN]
I'll go rouse the others[N]
resting in crew quarters.[A][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene4
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML][LoadPilar]
[MR]
Pilar! What's going on out there?[AN]
[ML]
Imperials found us, that's what.[AN]
The traps slowed them down,[N]
but that's all. They're coming![AN]
[MR]
Who would have tipped them off?[AN]
[Beat]No, that's not important right now.[N]
Let's greet our guests, shall we?[A][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene5
[ML][LoadElodia]
[R][LoadLua]
[ML]
So this is the hovel you call a base[Beat][N]
Allow me to introduce myself, pirates.[AN]
I am Elodia, an officer of T.O.R.C.H.[N]
I trust you know what that means?[AN]
[R][3LB]
Well, there's only one reason[N]
that the Pirate Hunter[N]
would pay me a visit.[AN]
[ML]
Good, no pretenses. To be specific,[N]
you and your crew are suspected[N]
of several counts of grand larceny.[AN]
Especially against the merchantry[Beat][N]
In order to verify the truth,[N]
I have a warrant for your arrest.[AN]
[R][2LB]
And what if I choose to not comply?[A]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]Under Article I, Section III[N]
of Incendivis legal code,[N]
that allows me to apply force.[AN]
Lethal force, if need be.[AN][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene6
[ML][LoadElodia]
[R][LoadLua]
[FFR][LoadRazvan][2LB]
[FFR][MoFR]
Miss Elodia[Beat]?[N]
Do you remember me, Razvan?[AN]
My master always spoke highly[N]
of you and your sound judgement.[AN]
I know this is selfish to ask,[N]
but please turn a blind eye.[AN]
Captain Lua may be a pirate,[N]
but she isn't a bad person.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
How did you end up here, Razvan?[AN]
I can take a guess, but[Beat][N]
Regardless, the law is immutable.[N]
Any who break it must face punishment.[AN]
[Beat]But under Article III, Section V,[N]
if one does so under duress,[N]
there are exceptions that can be made.[AN]
Do you understand what I'm saying?[AN]
[FR][ToggleMouthMove][2LB]
(Does she mean that I'm safe,[N]
so long as I betray you all?)[AN]
[R]
(Take the deal, Razvan. This is your[N]
chance to leave the pirate's life,[AN]
for good. Isn't that what you want?)[AN]
[FR]
(I...[.4])[AN]
[R][ToggleMouthMove][2LB]
Shouldn't have spelled it out so clear,[N]
Incendivis dog.[A] Now that I know,[N]
I won't give up my hostage here.[AN]
[FR]
Drop the act, Captain Lua![AN]
Miss Elodia, let me say it plain.[AN]
The captain saved my life,[N]
so I have a debt to repay.[AN]
Even if it means facing you,[N]
I won't waver a single step![AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Is that how it is, then?[AN]
Fine. If you're an accessory to theft,[N]
then I have to arrest you as well.[AN]
[R]
Ha, guess you're stuck with us then.[N]
Sorry, Pirate Hunter, but no surrender.[AN]
We both know I did exactly what you said,[N]
and that piratry is punished harshly.[AN]
As it happens, we were already leaving;[N]
you've just sped up our flight, is all![AN]
[ML]
You pirates never make it easy, do you?[AN]
I hoped that you were reasonable,[N]
but this is within my expectations.[AN]
You won't be able to flee so easily.[N]
Ignacio, it's time! Surround them![AN]
[R]
Razvan, follow me, we're[N]
getting back to the ship![AN][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene7
[MR][LoadIgnacio]
This damn well better be worth it[Beat][N]
Alright, Igniswords! Listen up![AN]
Our job is to hold position and keep[N]
this sorry bunch from flying off.[AN]
After the battle, anything on that[N]
ship and in this base is ours![AN][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene8
[FR][LoadDesiderio]
[R][LoadOrlando]
[ML][LoadLua]
[R]
I'm back, Lua![N]
[Beat]Well, this looks hairy.[AN]
[FR]
Talk about an understatement.[AN]
Ignacio showed up, and with[N]
his imperial masters in tow?[AN]
How the hell do we get out of this?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Instead of a problem, Desiderio,[N]
think of it as an opportunity.[AN]
Our crew's gotten fairly large.[N]
And our boat is fairly small[Beat][AN]
So instead of sinking that blowhard's[N]
ship, let's rout the [OQ]Igniswords[CQ][N]
and take it for ourselves, hm?[AN]
[FR]
You want to seize their boat?[AN][ToggleSmile]
Pff[Beat] Bahahaha! You're crazy, boss.[N]
Count me in! I've always wanted to cut[N]
that stupid crew of his down a peg.[AN]
What a dumb name[Beat][ToggleSmile] I'd better not see[N]
you come up with one half as stupid.[A]
[ML]
Our crew name can wait until after[N]
we're not at risk of dying immediately.[N]
Orlando, what's your plan here?[AN]
You're not really one of us,[N]
so maybe you should slink away.[AN]
[R]
You wound me, Lua. I'd never leave[N]
a friend in need! Though, if I did[Beat][N]
I don't suspect I'd get very far.[AN]
They'll have my wanted poster ready[N]
within a week, so why not stick around?[N]
Work was getting boring, anyhow.[AN]
[ML]
And Desiderio calls me crazy[Beat][N]
Well, I won't turn you down.[AN]
In fact, here's your first order;[N]
take half of our crew and defeat[N]
Ignacio's band over there, got it?[AN]
I'll take to the left and handle[N]
the main force of T.O.R.C.H.,[N]
protecting our main ship.[AN]
[R]
Already working me hard, eh?[N]
Fine, fine. Leave it to me, Lua![N]
I've still got some strength yet![AN][L][ClearFace][X]

## Ch2BeginningScene9
[ML][LoadLua]
[FR][LoadRahel]
W-What about me? I'm not cut out[N]
for this[Beat] I don't like impies,[N]
but this isn't my job, captain![AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Maybe so, but how do you explain[N]
being here with us? You don't have[N]
Orlando's connections, Rahel.[AN]
They'll know you worked with us,[N]
and that'll raise questions.[N]
Problems for Ida, most likely.[AN]
[FR]
I knew we shouldn't have taken this job,[N]
no matter how well it paid[Beat] Fine.[N]
I'm not going to cause Ida any trouble.[AN]
She's done enough for me as it is.[N]
If this is how it is, I'll fight with[N]
you and play pirate til we're safe.[AN]
But you'd better not get me killed,[N]
or Ida'll make you regret it, understand?[AN]
[ML]
Threatening your new captain already?[N]
Can't tell if you're brave or dumb[Beat][N]
But welcome aboard for now, Rahel.[AN][FL][ClearFace][MR]
Our goal is simple; protect our ship,[N]
take Ignacio's, then ready for takeoff![AN]
We won't be able to hang around port,[N]
so there's only one way to go now:[N]
deep into the unexplored outskirts.[AN]
It'll be a proper adventure,[N]
filled with gold and glory[Beat][AN]
So fight like hell and survive today,[N]
that we can take that path tomorrow![N]
Follow my lead, and we'll win this![A][X]

## Ch2EndingScene1
[FL][LoadDesiderio]
[L][LoadLua][3LB]
All that's left is getting out of here[N]
before those dogs can catch up to us.[N]
Desiderio, help me with these planks![AN]
[FL][2LB]
You got it, boss![AN][X]


## Ch2EndingScene2
[R][LoadOrlando]
[FR][LoadPilar]
[R]
I suppose that's our sign to follow suit.[N]
May I have your assistance, my lady?[AN]
[FR]
Save the charm for someone who cares.[N]
You'd better do your part, merchant.[AN]
[R]
You and Lua are far too alike[Beat][N]
Worry not, I'm no burden yet![A][X]

## Ch2EndingScene3
[ML][LoadElodia]
[ML]
[Beat]Hell. Headquarters won't let me hear[N]
the end of this failure, will they?[AN][X]


## Ch2EndingScene4
[ML][LoadElodia]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
Miss Elodia! I[Beat] I'm truly sorry[N]
that we had to meet again this way.[AN]
I hold no ill will towards Incendivis,[AN]
but my mother always told me that a man[N]
repays his debts. That's all this is.[AN]
[ML]
And in repaying your debt to the pirate[N]
captain, you've forgotten what you owe.[AN]
What would you or I be without the grace[N]
of the empire? Rats in a street gutter?[AN]
[MR]
Maybe so. But today, here?[AN]
You threatened the person whom[N]
I owe my life to, Miss Elodia.[AN]
Even if it means I become an outlaw,[N]
I can't allow you to bring her harm.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I can't cover for your actions here,[N]
you know. The rest of T.O.R.C.H. will[N]
demand a bounty for everyone here[Beat][AN]
It'll go to every civilized island[N]
in Incendivis. Even your hometown[Beat][N]
Even your mother will see your price.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]I have no desire to be a pirate,[N]
but if it's the only way to follow[N]
my heart, then call me what you like.[AN]
Even if the world turns against me,[N]
so long as I can do what's right,[N]
nothing could satisfy me more![AN][X]

## Ch2EndingScene5
[ML][LoadElodia]
[ML][MoMR]
[MR]
[3LB]
[Beat]Hmph. My greatest failure yet,[N]
and it's handed to me by a naive fool.[AN]
But I won't let it end like this,[N]
not with half my squad left.[AN]
I'll hunt them down to the last man,[N]
to the end of the world if I must[Beat][AN]
[FFL][LoadAlonso]
And how d'you plan on that?[A][X]

## Ch2EndingScene6
[MR][LoadElodia]
[ML][LoadAlonso]
[MR][3LB]
Stop where you stand,[N]
or you'll die there.[N]
Who are you?[AN]
[ML]
Ooh, fiery. You sure that's how you[N]
wanna talk to an informant, woman?[AN]
I pointed y'all here, after all.[AN]
The name's Alonso, y'see.[N]
Captain of the Blackhearts.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
And why shouldn't I take you in,[N]
hearing that name? Your crimes are[N]
far more severe than my quarries.[AN]
[ML]
Ha[Beat] hahahaha! You think you can?[AN]
Try it, then. Fair warning, though;[N]
I'm here knowin' you might do that,[N]
so it ain't gonna be that easy.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]What do you want?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Well, to see if you'd win, of course.[N]
And if not[Beat] to offer some back-up.[N]
Got here a bit too late, though.[AN]
I was keepin' tabs on the ship they[N]
took from us, among other things.[N]
The one they killed my men to take.[AN]
Now, I'm not one to act high and mighty;[N]
I know we're scum. But my rotten crew[N]
is MY bilge to do what I want with.[AN]
Anyone who'd do my men harm, or worse,[N]
kill 'em[Beat] they'll wish they fell[N]
to the Lands Below when I'm done.[AN]
So, since I want 'em dead, and you're[N]
the law, we've got some common ground.[N]
Why not team up, [OQ]Pirate Hunter[CQ]?[AN]
[MR]
I'd never join hands with a pirate.[AN]
But[Beat] if you were to sign a contract[N]
and offer your service to Incendivis,[N]
then I could at least consider it.[AN]
However, my superiors would need to[N]
permit it, and you would need to[N]
accept the life of a privateer.[AN]
[ML]
Like that fool Ignacio? Hard bargain[Beat][N]
No one's ever accused the Blackhearts[N]
of good deeds, and I like it that way.[AN]
But[Beat] if it means I can pay blood[N]
for blood, then it's worth it.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
If they surrender, I won't allow it,[N]
but if they resist[Beat] do what you will.[AN]
And I will give the orders here.[N]
Is that clear, Alonso?[AN]
[ML]
Crystal. You can call the shots,[N]
so long as I get their heads.[AN]
Let's get that contract over with[N]
already[Beat] I might need a drink.[A][X]

## Ch2EndingScene7
[MR][LoadRebelLeader][3LB]
Excellent. It seems those pirates[N]
escaped the empire's grip, after all.[AN]
The empire's hunting dogs appear as[N]
inept as their homeland is corrupt[Beat][AN]
And although I cheer their opponents,[N]
destruction without creation means nil.[AN]
A new world order must replace it.[N]
Anyone who does not understand that[N]
will never deserve the Fire Emblem.[AN]
I can only hope my ally makes the[N]
captain comprehend this simple truth,[N]
so we never need cross blades[Beat][A][X]

## Ch2Title
Ch 2: Flight of the Hunted[X]

## Ch2GoalWindow
Hijack/Defend[X]

## Ch2StatusObjective
  Protect Lua's boat[N]
while taking Ignacio's.[X]

## Chapter2Explanation
Orlando's group is in charge of hijacking[N]
Ignacio's boat as quickly as possible,[N]
doing so by routing every enemy on it.[AN]
After it is seized, it will take an[N]
additional [Red]3 Turns[Red] to ready for takeoff,[N]
so try to do this as soon as possible.[AN]
During this time, Lua's group must prevent[N]
enemies from reaching their own boat.[N]
If an enemy stands on it, [Red]Game Over.[Red][AN]
Units with blue diamonds will prioritize[N]
standing on it above all else, so make[N]
sure to not let them pass your forces.[AN]
The bosses will not move immediately,[N]
but they and their groups will charge[N]
after enough time has passed.[A][X]

airship humming. Orlando did it![AN]
Alright, everyone. We're done here![AN]
Fall back to the ship so we can[N]
get the hell out of here, now![A][X]

## Ch2AllIgniswordsDefeated
[MR][LoadOrlando]
Heh, that was as simple as could be![N]
Now, I just have to raise this ship, eh?[AN]
A challenge, certainly, but not one that[N]
I cannot handle! Watch and learn, Lua![A][X]

## Ch2ElodiasCharge
[ML][LoadElodia]
[Beat]I've seen enough of this.[AN]
My subordinates can't handle this[N]

## Ch2GriffinsShowUp
