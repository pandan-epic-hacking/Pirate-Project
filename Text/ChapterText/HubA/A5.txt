## ThePlan
[FL][LoadLua][L][LoadDesiderio][R][LoadPilar][FR][LoadRazvan]
[FL]
The plan is simple. We'll seize Jozef's[N]
supply ship to get into the Blessed Isle.[AN]
Word on the wind is he's producing a gun[N]
powerful enough to shift the tides of war,[AN]
we'll just kill the skilled artisans such[N]
that these plans are dead in the water.[AN]
[R]
I've heard of this scoundrel.[N]
Been peddling to both rebel and Empire.[AN]
Made so much gold, even afforded a place[N]
on the Blessed Isle with the bluebloods.[AN]
[FR]
How is the Empire letting[N]
him get away with that?[AN]
[3LB][FL]
When you have gold and weapons,[N]
you can afford friends in important[N]
places to keep yourself in the game.[AN]
Both sides want him gone, but they also[N]
won't confront him out of the fear he'd[N]
only sell his weapons to one side.[AN]
[2LB][L]
What a crook. At least supporters of[N]
either cause stick to their convictions.[A]
[R]
Because upstanding citizens like ourselves[N]
would never profit off such conflicts.[AN]
[L]
False equivalency. We don't[N]
manufacture conflict.[AN]
[3LB][R]
I wouldn't be so sure about that.[N]
Anyhow, we're likely doing everyone[N]
a favour by closing the factory up.[AN]
[2LB][FL]
I certainly hope they[N]
see it that way.[A]
[R]
Got something stuck[N]
in your mouth, Razvan?[AN]
You look as if you've been[N]
wanting to speak for a while.[AN]
[FR]
This mission ain't quite the same as[N]
battles we've fought previously.[AN]
The factory... They're just people doing[N]
their jobs, and we'll kill them for it?[AN]
Sorry, I don't mean to question your[N]
decisions. I'm sure you have good reason.[AN]
[L]
Everyone's doing their jobs, Razvan.[AN]
The Blackheart we had mop off the deck[N]
was probably just making ends meet,[AN]
perhaps sending a good portion of[N]
their gains back to their family.[AN]
[FR]
They were doing so at the expense[N]
of others, it's not the same.[AN]
[R][3LB]
One could say by manufacturing deadly[N]
weapons of war, are they not also[N]
profiting at the expense of others?[AN]
[FL]
If you're hoping for a better[N]
moral justification, Razvan,[N]
I can't give one to you.[AN]
Our nature as pirates means[N]
we'll always bring death to[N]
those that may not deserve it.[AN]
[1LB][FR]
If that's how it is...[A]
[L]
You'll get used to it.[A][X]


## Tangyuan1
[ML][LoadTangyuan][MR][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1]
[MR]
What are you doing on our[N]
property? No loitering.[A]
[3LB][ML]
It's pouring out there, my poor[N]
wyvern and I are as cold as it is.[N]
We'll be gone once the rain clears.[AN]
[1LB][MR]
Not my problem. Scram.[A]
[2LB][ML]
You really can't give a woman and[N]
a wyvern half an hour of shelter?[AN]
I see how it is. You're just doing[N]
this because you think you can.[AN]
You don't own this place, you're just[N]
a nobody wanting to push people around.[AN]
[MR]
So what if I am? The boss wouldn't want[N]
Vagrants like you stinking up the Isle.[AN]
[ML]
Please, I can smell you from here.[N]
I am not leaving until the rain goes.[A][X]


## ThePlan2
[ML][LoadMrMist][R][LoadLua][FR][LoadDesiderio]
[3LB][R]
The supplies ordered are all here. We'd like[N]
to request your hospitality, given we'd rather[N]
not make the return trip in this weather.[AN]
[2LB][ML]
You didn't open with[N]
the established codeword.[A]
[1LB][R]
You see, we were-[A]
[ML][Event]
Imposters! Invaders![A]
[ML][ClearFace]
[2LB][FR]
That was the shortest deception[N]
I've seen in my life, Boss.[AN]
[R]
It got us onto the Isle without being[N]
shot out of the sky, that's enough.[AN]
Let's clear them out before they can[N]
alert the rest of the Isle.[A][X]



## Tangyuan2
[ML][LoadTangyuan][MR][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1]
[MR]
Aha! I knew you were up to no good.[N]
Must be a scout for these invaders.[AN]
[ML]
Don't be ridiculous! Was it such a hard ask[N]
to stay under this roof for half an hour?[A]
[MR]
I am so smart. Boss is going to[N]
give me a promotion after this.[AN]
[ML]
You know what? Fine. I am with the invaders.[N]
I'll enjoy shoving my axe down your gullet.[A][X]

## Hakman1
[FL][LoadHakman][R][LoadTheDuke]
[R]
How can you lazy louts be so slow?[N]
This building was unfinished yesterday![AN]
[FL]
Our men are doing all we can in this rain.[N]
You think we can finish in an afternoon?[AN]
[R]
We don't get paid until you finish.[N]
I demand you put in some extra hours.[AN]
Getting between a mercenary and his[N]
gold is some dangerous business.[A]
[L]
Look. We are putting in extra hours,[N]
but there really isn't much else-[AN]
[R]
We can make life a tad less enjoyable[N]
for you fools, if you keep this up.[AN]
[L][LoadBigBrick]
[1LB][L]
Nice bow.[AN]
[R]
Hey! Give that-[AN]
[2LB][L]
[PlaySound][0x8F][0x8A][0x80][0x80]Couldn't want your spine[N]
breaking the same way.[AN]
[1LB][R]
...[A][X]


## Hakman2
[ML][LoadHakman][MR][LoadBigBrick]
[ML]
Wouldn't have guessed he[N]
had such speed in him.[A]
[3LB][MR]
I've seen his type too much. Bought a new[N]
bow and thinks he is on top of the world,[N]
but with neither skill nor courage.[AN]
Knowing what kind of person they are and[N]
how much you can push them is key to[N]
dealing with others as leader of the boys.[AN]
[2LB][ML]
Thanks for covering for me. I'm not[N]
cut out for leading, I fold too easily.[AN]
[MR]
Nonsense. Such skills can be taught,[N]
dedication to boys doesn't come easily.[AN]
With our last leader leaving us out to[N]
dry for gold, we need someone like you.[AN]
[ML]
Big Brick, you're leaving[N]
us aren't you?[A]
[1LB][MR]
Why would you say that?[A]
[2LB][ML]
You don't need to train me as a potential[N]
new leader of the boys if you're staying.[AN]
Whether it is in experience, smarts or[N]
contribution, you're more deserving.[AN]
[MR]
Yes, I was planning on leaving.[N]
Got some personal matters back home.[AN]
[2LB][ML]
The boys need you. You're the one who led[N]
us towards honest lives, a better future.[AN]
[MR]
There's no longevity in an organisation[N]
that depends on one person, Hakman.[AN]
[3LB][ML]
I suppose I'm selfishly redirecting my[N]
new responsibilities as leader onto you.[N]
But still.. don't know if I'm up for this.[AN]
[2LB][FFL]
Unidentified hostiles trying[N]
to get into a base![AN]
[FFR]
Someone get Big Brick![N]
And the boss![AN]
[MR]
We'll talk later. Let's get[N]
this out of the way.[A][X]


## TheDuke1
[L][LoadTheDuke]
[L]
We're under attack? I- I didn't think-[N]
Oh God. Stay calm, Mike. Don't panic.[A][X]

## MrMist1
[L][LoadMrMist]
[L]
I didn't hear of this raid, so must be the[N]
rebels trying to get an upper hand.[AN]
I'll just wait this one out and sneak out[N]
with the documents as they're distracted.[A][X]

## Yaoguai1
[L][LoadYaoguai]
[L]
Must be an empire raid, I suppose they[N]
are truly sick of working with Jozef.[AN]
What a good opportunity, no one will[N]
notice a missing schematic in the chaos.[A][X]

## Jozef1
[L][LoadJozef]
[L]
What is this? What are the security doing?[N]
No, no, no! My investment! Guards, guards![A][X]

## Jozef2
[ML][LoadJozef][MR][LoadTheCloser]
[MR]
I take it, Mr Jozef, that you accept[N]
the terms of our working agreement?[AN]
That we are not liable for any losses,[N]
and that we are to be paid immediately?[AN]
[ML]
Yes! Yes! I don't care about that now,[N]
THEY'RE GETTING AWAY! STOP THEM![AN]
[MR]
Very well. We will try to[N]
the utmost of our ability.[A][X]

## Jozef3
[ML][LoadJozef][MR][LoadTheCloser]
[MR]
A shame, it appears they escaped.[N]
I must still ask for the agreed payment.[A]
[ML]
Payment? PAYMENT? They got[N]
away! What do I pay you for?[AN]
[3LB][MR]
This was the terms of our contract,[N]
to be paid regardless of actual success.[N]
Did you not read the contract in full?[AN]
[2LB][ML]
They were smashing my place up![N]
You think I had the time?[AN]
[MR]
I don't see how that is my concern.[N]
The agreed total is written down here.[AN]
[ML]
W- W- What? This much? This is daylight[N]
robbery! You can't be serious![AN]
[FL][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1][L][LoadFace][0x6D][0x1]
[MR]
Breaking a contract[N]
here is... ill-advised.[AN] 
[ML][1LB]
F- Fine! Damn it![AN]
[2LB][MR]
Thank you for your business.[N]
May your future be prosperous.[AN]
[MR][ClearFace]
[FL][ClearFace]
[L][ClearFace]
[ML]
Prosperous? PROSPEROUS! They just robbed[N]
me of as much gold as those thieves did![AN]
All my life, I've put nothing less than my[N]
best to get out of the gutter of my birth.[AN]
Took the most undesirable, dangerous jobs[N]
in the Guild just to get through the door.[AN]
Trapped between the Empire and rebels,[N]
bribing and begging to keep myself alive.[AN]
Treated with scorn on the isle for earning[N]
my wealth rather than inheriting it.[AN]
Don't I deserve to be rewarded for my[N]
tenacity, to have faced impossible odds?[AN]
Why do good men struggle, when all that[N]
they work for is so easily taken away?[AN]
Those corrupt guards, those thieves...[N]
I won't let you go unpunished! I won't![A][X]

## WeWin
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
I wonder how Jozef is feeling right now.[N]
Never could take losses gracefully.[AN]
[MR]
Got away with his life, better[N]
off than some other of our foes.[AN]
[ML]
Not for long. His worth's been totalled[N]
and his allies are sure to abandon him.[AN]
With how many enemies he has in each[N]
faction, he'll be dead by the year's end.[AN]
[3LB][MR]
Can't say I'm sympathetic.[N]
Bad history with him in the[N]
Merchant's Guild, Boss?[AN]
[2LB][ML]
Certainly. You want to [N]
hear my oh-so tragic tale?[AN]
[MR]
Tales of past offences are more satisfying[N]
once the trangressor has been punished.[AN]
[ML]
I've mentioned in the passing my final[N]
unfortunate voyage on the Guild's behalf.[AN]
It was a joint venture with many ships,[N]
though safety in numbers did not help.[AN]
Against a fleet we could not outrun or[N]
outgun, Jozef came up with a simple plan.[AN]
[MR]
I suspect you didn't like[N]
the plan very much.[AN]
[ML]
It was a sound suggestion. A good vessel[N]
distracts the foes while the rest flee,[AN]
the sacrifice of one for the whole.[N]
You may have guessed who was chosen.[AN]
[MR]
How pathetic. What good is an alliance if[N]
they couldn't even stand up for their own?[AN] 
[ML]
I learned that the bigger picture matters[N]
a lot less when it's to my detriment.[AN]
[MR]
Even pirates are much less likely[N]
to betray one of their own.[AN]
While it was a fine tale, it doesn't[N]
double as payment, eh, Boss?[AN]
[ML]
My coffers are essential[N]
the crew's coffers already.[A]
[1LB][MR]
It's the spirit of the matter.[A][X]
