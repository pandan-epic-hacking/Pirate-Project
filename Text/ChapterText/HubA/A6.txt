Rout[X]

## ChA6StatusObjective
Defeat all enemies,[N]
and disarm all bombs.[X]

## ChA6Pre1
[FL][LoadRedFighter][L][LoadRedSoldier][MR][LoadSantiago]
[FL]
This is incredible[Beat][AN]
At last, we have the power to[N]
strike back at the empire![AN]
This looks like enough to level[N]
the imperial palace![AN][X]

## ChA6Pre2
[FL][LoadRedFighter][L][LoadRedSoldier][MR][LoadSantiago]
[FL]
[3LB][L]
Don't be ridiculous, we'd never[N]
get close enough. They'd blast us[N]
out of the sky.[AN]
How about Delgado Harbor?[N]
It'd be easy to slip in and out[N]
unsuspected.[AN]
[MR]
No, that won't do. Too many innocents[N]
will be harmed.[AN]
We want to hit the imperial dogs, not[N]
those suffering under their tyranny.[AN]
We've got enough for two targets,[N]
so we'll attack the marine barracks[N]
and the imperial smithy.[AN]
Anyone fool enough to serve the[N]
Imperial Navy deserves what's coming.[AN]
[L]
Right as ever, boss.[N]
Heh, I can't wait to stick it[N]
to those imperial bastards.[AN]
[L][ClearFace][FL][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadSlicer][L][LoadDicer]
[FL]
Bad news, Santiago. There's an[N]
incoming ship, and its crew[N]
looks ready for a fight.[AN]
[R]
Just my luck[Beat][N]
How the hell did this happen?[AN]
You didn't blab about this, did you?[N]
To anyone other than me, that is.[AN]
[2LB][L]
No way! You gave us a better deal[N]
than we could've dreamt of.[AN]
Wasn't much point looking for other[N]
buyers after an offer like yours.[AN]
[FL]
It must be that idiot merchant who[N]
hired us to move the goods.[AN]
Didn't think he had it in him to[N]
pick a fight with us over this.[AN]
[MR]
Doesn't matter anymore, looks like[N]
we've got a fight on our hands.[AN]
Lucky for us, we rebels are always[N]
ready for battle.[AN]
I trust your men can hold their own?[AN]
[L]
You bet! C'mon boys, let's welcome[N]
our uninvited guests![AN]
[L][ClearFace][FL][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadRedFighter][L][LoadRedSoldier]
[3LB][MR]
My comrades, this is a fight we must win.[AN]
But if we should fall, we cannot allow[N]
the enemy to learn of our plans.[AN]
Quickly, set up explosives around the[N]
cave. If we win this battle, we'll[N]
disarm them afterwards, but if not[Beat][AN]
The cause is greater than any one of us.[N]
If the worst comes to pass, we'll bury[N]
the enemy in here with us.[AN]
[1LB][FL]
Yes sir![AN]
[L]
We're with you to the end![AN]
[MR]
Good, let's give them hell![AN]
[X]

## ChA6Pre3
[R][LoadLua][FR][LoadRochefort]
[R]
Come on out! We're here for the[N]
spice shipment you stole![AN][X]

## ChA6Pre4
[R][LoadLua][FR][LoadRochefort]
[FL][LoadSlicer][L][LoadDicer]
[1LB][FL]
Spice shipment?[AN]
[1LB][L]
The hell are you talking about?[AN]
[3LB][R]
Playing dumb won't help.[N]
Now hand it over, and[N]
no one has to get hurt.[AN]
[2LB][FL]
We've stolen a lot of stuff,[N]
but spices ain't one of them.[AN]
[1LB][L]
Always preferred my food mild myself.[AN]
[2LB][FL]
That's not what[Beat] ah forget it.[N]
You want a fight, you've got one![AN]
[L]
Wait, isn't that the guy who hired[N]
us to transport the-[AN]
[FR]
Captain Lua, I'm afraid we've no[N]
choice but to battle it out.[AN]
[3LB][R]
What the hell is going on? Rochefort,[N]
if there's something you're keeping[N]
from me, now's the time to explain.[AN]
[FR]
I've been nothing but forthright with[N]
you. What are you waiting for?[N]
I didn't hire you to chat![AN]
[FR][ClearFace]
[2LB][R]
This whole situation reeks. Desiderio,[N]
lift the anchor, we're turning around.[AN]
[FFR]
No can do, captain.[N]
They've already got us grappled![AN]
[3LB][FL]
You think we'll let you go so easily?[N]
You've got a mighty fine ship,[N]
I think we'll add it to our collection![AN]
[R][MoveFarRight]
[3LB][R][LoadSuzanne]
Finally, some action. Come on, meathead![N]
Your face'll look so much better[N]
filled with lead![AN]
[2LB][L]
Bring it on, girl![N]
I've been itching for a good fight.[AN]
[ClearFace][R][ClearFace]
[3LB][R][LoadMatteo]
Don't get started without me![AN]
You don't look like much, think[N]
you can keep up with a swordsman[N]
of my caliber?[AN]
[2LB][FL][MoveLeft]
Is that a challenge? Lucky for you, you[N]
won't live long enough to regret it![AN]
[ClearFace][R][ClearFace]
[FR]
Oh no[Beat] Looks like we're going with[N]
plan A, crew! To arms![AN]
[X]

## ChA6BombWarning
[3LB][L][LoadLua]
Is that sulfur I smell?[AN]
What the[Beat] Everyone, be careful![N]
This cave is rigged with explosives![N]
Cut their fuses before it's too late.[AN][X]

## ChA6BombInfoBox
Bombs can be disarmed by attacking[N]
them with a sword, lance, axe, or[N]
knife at 1 range.[A][X]

## ChA6BombExplodes
[L][LoadLua]
No, we're too late![N]
The cave is collapsing![AN]

## ChA6End1
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadRochefort]
[ML]
Alright, Rochefort.[N]
You've got a lot of explaining to do.[AN]
[3LB][MR]
I swear, I didn't expect this to happen![AN]
I had no idea these pirates were[N]
cooperating with the rebels.[N]
It was just bad timing, I assure you.[AN]
[ML]
Alright, where are your [OpenQuote]spices" then?[N]
All these crates are full of gunpowder[N]
and nitroglycerin.[AN]
[2LB][MR]
They must have sold them already.[N]
I've never seen these crates before![AN]
[3LB][ML]
I'm not an idiot, it's clear as day[N]
that these explosives were the goods[N]
you wanted us to recover for you.[AN]
It's no wonder you were willing to[N]
pay so much gold for them.[AN]
[MR]
Fine, so what if they were?[N]
You took this job for the money,[N]
so what's it matter to you?[AN]
You're a pirate, who are you to[N]
judge how others make their coin?[AN]
[ML]
Pirate or no, we're no Blackhearts.[N]
There are some lines I won't cross.[N]
Our deal is off. Seize him![AN]
[MR][MoveFarRight][R][LoadMatteo]
[R]
Not so fast! Rochefort may be a snake,[N]
but I still work for him. I won't[N]
hand him over to you without a fight.[AN]
[FR][ClearFace][FR][LoadSuzanne]
They're not bad, but I bet we can[N]
take 'em. One step closer, and it'll[N]
be your funeral![AN]
[2LB][R]
So what'll it be? You can have your[N]
gold, and we'll be on our way.[AN]
Or would you prefer to test[N]
your blade against mine?[AN]
[ML][MoveFarLeft][L][LoadDesiderio]
[3LB][L]
Captain, if I may?[AN]
You two, what's your price?[N]
Whatever you're being paid,[N]
I'm sure we can match it.[AN]
Come work for us instead.[AN]
[R]
You want us to join your crew?[N]
We may be sellswords, but[N]
piracy is a bit of a jump.[AN]
You don't seem so bad, but I'm not[N]
sure a life of crime suits me.[AN]
[FL]
A bit late for that, don't you think?[N]
Last I checked, smugging explosives[N]
isn't sanctioned by the empire.[AN]
[2LB][FR]
She's got us there, Matteo. Besides,[N]
I think I'd make a pretty great pirate.[AN]
As long as there's good pay and good[N]
fights, I could get used to it.[AN]
[R]
Alright then, 5,000 gold up front,[N]
plus a fair wage.[AN]
[FR]
Each. Mercenaries of our caliber[N]
don't work for cheap.[AN]
[3LB][FL]
Fine, but for that much money[N]
you'd better pull your weight.[AN]
Go ahead and take your gold from[N]
your former employer. I made sure he[N]
had our fee ready when we set sail.[AN]
[2LB][FR]
Aye aye, captain! Heh, I'm feeling[N]
like a pirate already![AN]
[ClearFace][R][ClearFace]
[1LB][FFR]
Hey, what are you doing? Unhand me![AN]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
[3LB][MR]
Captain, what should we do with[N]
all these explosives?[N]
We can't just leave them here.[AN]
[FL]
We could take them with us, in case[N]
we need them in the future.[AN]
I could repurpose some into something[N]
we could carry into battle as well.[AN]
Ah, it's a shame this job didn't[N]
turn out how I'd hoped, but at least[N]
it's not a total loss.[AN]
[MR]
I recognized the guy in the back[N]
giving orders. That was Santiago,[N]
a famed rebel commander.[AN]
He looked just like the wanted posters.[AN]
Every imperial soldier knows of him,[N]
he's notoriously radical even among[N]
the rebels.[AN]
Who knows what kind of dastardly plot[N]
he was planning?[AN]
[2LB][L]
Unfortunately, they were determined[N]
to take their secrets to the grave.[AN]
I offered several the chance to[N]
surrender, but none took me up on it.[AN]
[3LB][FL]
Whatever it was, I'm glad we stopped it.[N]
It's been a long day, let's salvage[N]
whatever we can, then head back to port.[AN]
