[R][LoadLua]
[R]
[Beat]Anything to report[N]
up above, Pilar?[AN]
[L]
Take your guess, captain.[AN]
[R]
Unfortunate.[AN][CloseEyes]
Three days of scouring the skies,[N]
and no luck whatsoever.[AN][OpenEyes]
Are there truly no other ships[N]
interested in this route?[AN]
[L]
It would seem so[Beat][AN]
At this rate, it may soon be time to[N]
cut our losses and return to port.[AN]
[R][3LB]
You may be right, Pilar.[AN]
As useful as a supply raid on [N]
a merchant would be, we could [N]
be stockpiling elsewhere.[AN]
[FL][2LB]
Hm. [A]It feels somewhat unusual to be[N]
wanting action onboard a ship.[AN]
I get that piracy surrounds that[N]
very notion, certainly, but[Beat][AN]
I suppose I'm just used to long[N]
moments of quiet in the clergy.[AN]
Having to risk your life near the[N]
front lines is quite the experience--[AN]
Not that I mind, of course, captain.[.4][N]
My healing is the least I can do for you.[AN]
[R]
Most ships would rather reach[N]
solid ground than swashbuckle around.[AN]
If you talked to me several months[N]
ago, I would have said the same thing.[AN]
[Beat]Except the whole clergy business.[AN]
No offense Razvan, but I'd rather be a[N]
swabber than be donned in robes.[AN]
[L]
Agreed here, Lua.[N]
It sounds[Beat] stifling.[AN]
[FL]
Oh, indeed it was![AN]
But again, I was quite[N]
accustomed to it.[AN]
And as boring as you might think[N]
it was, it was an opportunity too.[AN]
It gave me plenty of time to[N]
work on literacy and staves.[AN]
[L]
I believe those efforts have paid off.[AN]
To think moments of prayer would[N]
aid in truly boosting your magic.[AN]
That sounds quite foreign to me.[AN]
[R]
Makes me wonder though.[AN]
If I trained in even just a bit[N]
of prayer, could I use a staff?[AN]
I must admit, it would be a [N]
useful skill to have on the field.[AN]
[FL][3LB]
It's more than just pure [N]
prayer, Captain Lua. [AN]
It might seem innocent, but stave[N]
training was one of the trickiest[N]
things I've had to do in my life.[AN]
Even experienced magi can find[N]
it tricky to wield staves at first.[AN]
[L][2LB][ToggleSmile]
Heh.[A] And experienced curates[N]
might find it tricky to wield tomes too?[AN]
[FL][ToggleSmile]
Uh[Beat][AN]
W-Well, tomes are a complicated[N]
topic as well, but--[AN]
[R]
Relax, Razvan.[AN]
Pilar's just pulling your leg.[AN]
[FL]
Oh[Beat]I see, Miss Lua.[AN]
[L][3LB]
It's tricky for me to poke fun.[AN]
I respect our captain a little[N]
bit too much, first off.[AN]
The other crew members I don't[N]
know too well for the moment[Beat][AN]
Desiderio is still a fine target, though.[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow]
[Event]// Play armored knight footsteps sound.
[L][1LB]
Ah.[.4] Speak of the devil. [AN]
[FL][2LB]
Hmm, what do you mean?[AN]
[Beat]Those footsteps coming[N]
down the stairs?[AN]
[L]
Yes.[A] Notice how heavy they are?[AN]
You begin to understand how distinct they[N]
are when they keep you awake at night[Beat][AN]
[FR][LoadDesiderio]
Oi, boss[Beat]or, hell,[N]
everyone else I guess.[AN]
[R]
We were just mentioning you, actually.[AN]
What's the situation?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Huh? Speakin' about me[N]
behind my back, eh?[AN]
I hope it still isn't over[N]
that poker game.[AN]
[Beat]Feels like that was ages[N]
ago already, actually.[AN]
[L]
Get to it, Desiderio.[AN]
You somehow manage to see something [N]
in the horizon that I didn't?[AN]
[FR]
Sure did, and let me tell you,[AN]
it seems pretty interesting.[AN]
Gotta be a ship, but it's[Beat][N]
thicker than what I'd expect.[AN]
[R][1LB]
Thicker[Beat]?[AN]
What do you mean by that?[AN]
[FR][2LB]
Thicker[Beat] There's gotta be[N]
a better word for it[Beat][AN]
Like, the shape's all weird and[N]
stuff out in the horizon, but--[AN]
[FR][MoveFarRight]
Ahh, it's just weird, and you[N]
all should help me take a look.[AN]
[L]
Guess I can help confirm it.[N]

before joining you all topside.[AN][ClearFace]//[CSSCF]?

sky out there, higher in the air.[AN]
[FL]
Hmm[Beat]judging from the distance.[Beat][AN]
I'd say roughly twenty or so miles[N]
out, half a mile of altitude.[AN]
[R][LoadLua]
[R]
Your aptitude for aeronautics[N]
is always impressive, Pilar.[AN]
[FL]
Ah, captain.[AN]
It was merely an estimate, there's[N]
no need for flattery here.[AN]
[R]
I'll go ahead and make[N]
the approach, then.[AN]
If it's a merchant ship, [N]
you all know the drill.[AN]
Hail them and see if they're [N]
affiliated with any imperials.[AN]
If they are, then demand the[N]
surrender of their goods![AN]
[L]
Of course, boss[Beat][AN]
Still, I gotta wonder why that[N]
shape looks so weird.[AN]
Isn't like any ship[N]
I've seen before[Beat][AN]
[FL]
You did mention that, hm?[AN]
I did not think my eyes were deceiving[N]
me, but I can have another look.[AN]
May I borrow your spyglass, captain?[AN]
[R][MoveRight]
Here you are, Pilar.[AN]
[FL]
One moment[Beat][AN]
[CloseEyes][.4]
[L]
Tch, maybe it's one of those weird[N]
ships I've heard rumors about.[AN]
[FL][OpenEyes]
[R]
Oh?[.4] Rumors you say? [AN]
Busy drinking at a tavern, and[N]
found too many bits of gossip?[AN]
[L][3LB]
You know me too well, boss.[AN]
Talked to some drunk sailor about[N]
it at the port, so take their garbled[N]
word with a grain of salt[Beat][AN]
Some shipwrights are going bold with[N]
their designs and construction.[AN]
Unusual hull shapes, multi-deck[N]
design, physical wings attached[N]
to the ships, ridiculous ideas[Beat][AN]
Hell, I even heard out there that[N]
some crew's trying to find a design[N]
stable enough to put cannon onboard.[AN]
[R][2LB]
Cannons onboard a ship?[AN]
That crew in question must be[N]
looking for a deathwish, then.[AN]
Wonder what kinds of people[N]
are coming up with these ideas[Beat][AN]
[FL]
You two.[AN]
I can attest that there's[N]
no crazy design at play here.[AN]
[L]
What makes you say that, eh?[AN]
[FL]
It's not one just one 'thick' ship.[AN]
Or a weird shape.[AN]
[Event]//change music
[FL]
Those are two ships right[N]
next to each other[Beat][AN]
Grapples and boarding planks[N]
are between the two of them.[AN]
We're witnessing a plundering[N]
right before our eyes.[AN]
[L]
You have to be joking[Beat][AN]
[FL]
If you want to see it[N]
yourself so badly, here.[AN]
[L][MoML]
[ML]
[Beat][Beat][Beat]
[ML][MoveMidLeft]
[ML][MoL]
[L]
[Beat]No, no you weren't joking.[AN][Clear]
Damn.[.4][N]
Care to see yourself, boss?[AN]
[R]
No need, if both of you see that[N]
it's two ships, then it's two ships.[AN]
Anything else you're gleaming[N]
from the sight, Pilar?[AN]
[FL]
Hmm[Beat][AN]
[Beat]It's too far to tell the affiliation[N]
of either of them, unfortunately.[AN]
It's likely that one of them must be a[N]
pirate crew raiding the other.[AN]
Imperial marines don't often [N]
resort to boarding actions.[AN]
[Beat]Rebel forces potentially could, but [N]
it's most likely some sort of plunderer.[AN]
[L]
Sounds like a chance to beat[N]
down some opposing pirates then.[AN]
Those guys gotta have plenty[N]
of loot we can take back from 'em.[AN]
Maybe we can even get their[N]
ship back to port once we clear it.[AN]
[FL]
It could be risky, if both crews are[N]
hostile to our arrival[Beat][AN]
If it's your typical pirate raid, then I'm sure[N]
the other crew would take any help.[AN]
Though, if they're one of the merchants[N]
we're trying to take down, well[Beat][AN]
[L]
Then we get double the[N]
plunder, in that case![AN]
Sounds more of a win to me.[AN]
[R]
Whether the other ship is one we're[N]
aiding or capturing, we'll have to see.[AN]
Tell the crew to get ready for combat;[.4][N]
we're moving in to intercept this raid.[AN]
Get the grappling hooks and planks[N]
set in position, be prepared to board![AN]
[FL]
Of course, captain.[AN]

Everyone![AN]
You're all hearing the lady![AN]
Get your feet moving, and[N]

[3LB]
Well[Beat][N]
To think these pirates would be so[N]
bold to attack an imperial ship[Beat][AN]
[L][2LB]
They're probably wanting to ransack[N]
this ship for weapons and equipment.[AN]
The ship may be a mere sloop, but their[N]
arsenal would be very useful to bear[Beat][AN]
Still, it seems rather foolish to have[N]
a lone ship out on patrol.[AN]
Typically, the empire sends out [N]
ships in pairs at minimum[Beat][AN]
[FL]
Maybe they used ballistae[N]
to take down their fellow ship?[AN]
Took one out, then boarded the other?[AN]

A possibility, if they only [N]
wanted the one ship.[AN]

W-Well, it sounds bad, but[N]
really, Pilar's got a point;[AN]
imperial ships do tend to have[N]
valuable supplies.[AN]
I don't have anything personal[N]

But, if these guys have already[N]
wiped out their crew, well[Beat][AN]
Being able to seize both ships would[N]
be pretty good, y'know?[AN]
[FL]
And what if there are still[N]
survivors, Desiderio?[AN]
We can't just[Beat]loot an[N]
imperial ship like this![AN]
I understand Captain's Lua's goal of[N]
hitting merchants, but the empire itself?[AN]

Tch, if only I was one of those[N]
crazy beasts, that'd be fun[Beat][AN]
[ML][LoadLua]
Hey, you there![AN]
[MR]
Huh?! [A][MR][MoveMidRight]
H-Hey, back off, scoundrel![AN]
I, as a scoundrel myself, [N]
am not afraid to strike ba--[AN]
Oh, wait![.4] You don't seem [N]
like one of those miscreants![AN]
[ML]
And you don't seem like[Beat][AN]
Well, actually, you do seem like a[N]
miscreant, but not THEIR miscreant.[AN]
Were you part of the imperial crew?[AN]
[MR]
You wound me, comparing me[N]
to either a pirate or imperial![AN]
I'm not affiliated with either of[N]
these factions, not at all![AN]
My name is Juan![AN]
I[Beat]am simply travelling with these[N]
people, and have done no wrongdoing![AN]
[ML]
And with that goofy tone of yours,[N]
I'm inclined to believe otherwise[Beat][AN]
Out with it![AN]
[MR]
Well, very well, I will admit the truth![AN]
I was in need of cheap travel, and[N]
I met these 'merry' men at a tavern![AN]
By meet I mean[Beat]got grazed by a[N]
stray mug, before fists started flying![AN]
I helped many men here escape[N]
from the approaching guardsmen![AN]
[ML]
You[Beat]got this crew out[N]
of a bar fight?[AN]
[MR]
Yes, yes, quite the blunder[Beat][.4][AN]
But it found me a way out of that[N]
port, so I couldn't complain![AN]
Figured it'd at least be a quiet ride[N]
until we made it to the next port.[AN]
Of course, these gentleman could[N]
not resist the luster of a lone ship![AN]
And I could not resist the luster[N]
of their leftover gold![AN]
[CloseEyes]Unfortunately, that meant they could[N]
not resist wanting to cleave me as well![AN]
[ML]
So there really was only[N]
one Incendivis ship?[AN]
Interesting[Beat]but regardless, you[N]
seem like you'll need a friendlier crew.[AN]
[MR][OpenEyes]
Quite so, especially one that actually[N]
appreciates the craft of knife throwing.[AN]
Or[Beat]about how I consider myself[N]
to be quite the proficient pickpocket?[AN]
Sure, any unkindly person can mug [N]
someone of their hard-earned cash.[AN]
But I consider myself an artist![AN]
Apparently, the pirates didn't appreciate[N]
it so much against them, huh?[AN]
[ML]
We'll take the talent, as long as those [N]
fingers stay in our enemy's pockets.[AN]
If you can do that and use a knife,[N]
you might keep some stolen coin.[AN]
[MR]
Sounds like a plan, cap'n![AN]
Just[Beat]be careful of the enemies[N]
who are approaching as we speak![AN]

I'd thought it'd be.[AN]

You got that right, boss.[AN]
Those rebels were crazy, thinking[N]
that we were some imperials.[AN]
How'd they even fall for that[N]
captain's ruse so easily?[AN]

[L]
[Beat]A matter of circumstance, I suppose.[AN]
If we'd managed to contact them first,[N]
we might have rused them instead.[AN]

[FL]

With the way those pirates looked?[AN]
Hah![AN]
At least the marines have hygiene[N]
standards, I'll give them that.[AN]
No good pirate crew should be[N]
going around looking like that.[AN]

[FR]
So you're saying we all look[N]
nice and pampered, Desiderio?[AN]
How thoughtful of you.[AN]

[R]
The banter can wait[N]
for a little while.[AN]
Desderio, Pilar.[AN]
Lead the rest of the crew to[N]
secure the other two decks.[AN]

Didn't stand much of a chance[N]

It could have been me on [N]
an imperial ship like this.[AN]
Slaughtered to the last man[N]

It is a terrible thought[Beat][AN]

[R]
Unfortunately, some pirates[N]
are simply that unforgiving.[AN]
Certainly, piracy is not kind[N]
to begin with, not at all.[AN]
But some dastardly crews are more[N]
than willing to revel in cruelty.[AN]

[FR]
[Beat]I suppose at least this all was[N]
quicker than being marooned.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Hah, it's a dreadful thought[N]
to be thinking of my own case here.[AN]
I was lucky enough to be rescued,[N]

[FFL][MoL]
Here, I thought I was going to have[N]
only one dose of luck today.[AN]
Turns out, you folk seem like the[N]
cause behind the pirates turning tail.[AN]
What's going on, was there[N]
some sort of mutiny on board?[AN]

[FR]
A different story, ma'am.[AN]
We're your rescuers, from[N]
a different vessel entirely.[AN]

[L][1LB]
A different vessel?[AN]
I'll be damned.[AN]

[R][2LB]
We're not jesting here.[AN]
I'm Captain Lua, captain of the[N]
merchant vessel over there.[AN]
We saw that your ship was[N]
besieged by pirates in the distance.[AN]
So, we took matters into our own hands.[AN]

[L]

Merchants you say?[AN]
I am Captain Castila of[N]
the INS Snared Talon.[AN]
I must say, you all must be rather[N]
well-armed for a merchant vessel.[AN]

[R]

In a route as suspicious as this?[AN]
It would have been foolish to not[N]
hire a decent amount of protection.[AN]

[L]
I'm still suprised you all managed[N]
to best a gang of pirates.[A]
[Beat]But I can't say I don't[N]
appreciate that fact.[AN]
The gods know we should've been[N]
more prepared in this region too.[AN]
[Beat]What's that other vessel behind[N]
the pirate's ship, though?[AN]
You only mentioned having[N]
your one ship.[AN]

[FR]
This may sound hard to believe.[AN]
But that was a rebel ship that had[N]
been seemingly patrolled the area.[AN]
They joined in on the action, and[N]
aligned with the pirates against us.[AN]
It seems like they thought we[N]
were escorted, aligned with you all.[AN]

[L][1LB]
You're kidding me[Beat][A]
Rebels as well. [.4]Damn.[AN]

[R][2LB]
I wish I was kidding.[AN]
Beyond anything our crew expected,[N]
but we managed to prevail.[AN]

[L]
Which I'm glad for, otherwise all[N]
our heads would be on pikes right now.[AN]

[FFL]
Um[Beat]is everything alright[N]
out there captain?[AN]
I-I've got my musket ready, if[N]
you need me to get out there and--[AN]

[L]
No need to, Valerie.[AN]

I have to admit, I didn't think[N]
there were any survivors left here.[AN]
With how lifeless the deck was,[N]
it seemed like we were too late.[AN]

[FL]
They[Beat]they were definitely going[N]
to kill us all if you all didn't help![AN]
T-Thank you so much![.4][N]
Those jerks really took us by surprise![AN]
Thinking they're going to get[N]
rich off of fertilizer and wheat![AN]
How foolish of them, hah![AN]

O-Oh, was I not supposed[N]
to blurt that out?[AN]
Um[Beat]sorry captain...[AN]

While my men up here are moving, 
we now have gravely injured men[N]
If we may recruit you for[N]
just a moment, we would--[AN]

No need to ask further.[AN]

Isn't that a heal staff[N]
you're holding right now?[AN]

sentimental staff, actually[Beat][AN]
[ML][1LB]
Sentimental[Beat]?[A] How so?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
This was a gift from my mother, when[N]
I first became a curate proper.[AN]
I'd borrowed ones before when I was[N]
training with my local church, but[N]
this was my first real staff.[AN]
It's been drained for quite some[N]
time though[Beat]so in other words,[N]
I'm utterly useless right now.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Wow[Beat][A]E-Erm, not wowing in[A]
disappointment or anything but, u-uh[AN]
Don't you worry,because[A]

## A4_EndEvent_6

//Valerie and Razvan follow another soldier back into the ship. Dialogue returns to Lua and the imperial captain.

// XXXX | Captain |    | Lua | XXXX

[R][LoadLua]
[L][LoadA4ImperialCaptain]
Heh[Beat]Your curate seemed very[N]
eager to lend a helping hand.[AN]
I'm glad to know there are still[N]
good samaritans along these routes.[AN]

[R]
He studied under an[N]
imperial priest, actually.[AN]
I've been grateful to have[N]
him on-board my ship.[AN]

[L]
Is that so?[AN]
Then I'm certain he's more[N]
than capable to help us.[AN]
His aid is much appreciated.[AN]

[R]
I have to admit, I'm now curious[N]
after what your crewman just said.[AN]
It seems your ship isn't handled[N]
to deliver cargo en masse.[AN]
Why's a ship like yours[N]
doing it all alone?[AN]

[L]
This sort of stuff is classified.[AN]
[Beat]But since you did help save us,[N]
and this mission's been rough[Beat][AN]
Yes, as Valerie hinted...[.4][N]
ah, no--[.4] directly said.[AN]
We're delivering farming [N]
supplies over to Rockwell.[AN]

[R]
Makes sense those mining [N]
isles would need those supplies.[AN]
But why send a single navy vessel[N] 
instead of a proper convoy?[AN]

[L][3LB]
We were told that this route[N]
was a quiet one, with minimal[N]
signs of pirate activity.[AN]
That, [OpenQuote]there's no need to hire[N]
a merchant, because[N]
we can do it ourselves!"[AN][Clear]
A lone ship[Beat]in an isolated[N]
region of the empire.[AN]
Without any backup to speak of.[AN]
Did the port *truly* think this route[N]
was going to be completely safe?[AN]

[R][2LB]
Sounds as if your problems are with[N]
that port sent you in without help.[AN]

[L][3LB]
Damn straight they are;[.4][N]
I'd rather prioritize me and my[N]
men's safety over anything else.[AN]
Being forced onto a desperate[N]
defensive like this over a lack of[N]
intelligence is rather irritating.[AN]
It's not that I don't consider this[N]
mission important either.[AN]
I'm sure Rockwell needs the help,[N]
but this delivery needed some more[N]
planning[Beat]and an actual merchant.[AN]

[R]
Seems like we need to prioritize[N]
our merchants some more then.[AN]
Definitely no bias here, of course.[AN]
Will you be able to make[N]
it to Rockwell safely from here?[AN]

[L]
With your cleric's help, we should[N]
be able to stabilize ourselves.[AN]
This is[Beat]a complicated situation,[N]
honestly, but we'll figure it out.[AN]
As long as we don't get plummet into[N]
the depths below, we have it covered.[AN]

[R]
I suppose I'll leave it to you then.[AN]
I'll tell my crew to hand the[N]
this reins of this over to you.[AN]
Once Razvan is done tending to[N]
your men, we'll be off.[AN]

[L]

Ah, wait just one moment, captain.[AN]

[R][1LB]
Hmm?[AN]

[L]
You and your crew saved our lives.[AN]
We've been extremely [N]
fortunate to have your aid.[AN]
Here, a small--[.4] no, large token of[N]
me as well as my crew's thanks.[AN]
Safe travels to you, Captain Lua.[AN]

[R]

To you as well, Castila.[AN][X]

[FL]
A four-way grappling maneuver[Beat][N]
Pirates, rebels, and imperials.[AN]
I can't say I expected to ever be[N]
a part of that sort of thing.[AN]
Three ships, sure, [.4]but add[N]
an extra ship to the mix?[AN]
That was too chaotic.[AN]
[FR][LoadDesiderio][ToggleSmile]
A four way maneuver, huh?[AN]
Heh, you'd see plenty of those 'manuevers'[N]
if you travel into town late at nigh--[AN]
[R][ToggleSmile]
Desiderio.[AN][ToggleSmile]
[FR]
Sorry, sorry, couldn't resist.[AN]
[L][ToggleSmile]
It's fortunate we managed[N]
to come out on top in this brawl.[AN]
Who knows how chaotic it would[N]
have been had no lines been drawn?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]A shame we didn't plunder[N]
as much as we hoped, though.[AN]
Any of these ships, even the worst one, [N]
would've given a tidy bounty.[AN]
[L]
Well, it was inevitable if the[N]
Incendivis had survivors.[AN]
Were it some normal merchant,[N]
perhaps, but Incendivis?[.4] Keep dreaming.[AN]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Instead, we might've just given them an[N]
extra two ships to use instead[Beat][AN][OpenEyes]
[R]
A shame that the empire might've[N]
gotten those ships, sure.[AN]
[Beat][A]But it didn't feel right to[N]
further harm them after that fight.[AN]
Not even out of simply wanting to[N]
avoid antagonizing the marines.[AN]
[FL]
I thought you held quite the grudge[N]
against the marines, Miss Lua.[AN]
Sure, I'm glad we didn't go through[N]
with that idea[Beat]but don't you?[AN]
[R][3LB]
I do, and still do.[AN]
Their captain was a rarity among the[N]
officers I've seen and heard about.[AN]
In fact[Beat]she seemed more than[N]
content with doing simple work for[N]
the empire, rather than bold offensives.[AN]
But, if that ship was at least doing[N]
something to patch up these isles, [N]
then they can go on by, no trouble.[AN]
I wouldn't want to seize supplies[N]
meant for farmers and hungry folk.[AN]
[L][2LB]
[Beat]A noble thought, Lua.[AN]
But, if they couldn't be bothered to send[N]
more than one ship, I doubt it's a trend.[AN]
Wouldn't surprise me if the Incendivis[N]
turned those plows into swords.[AN]
[FR]
With groups like those rebels coming in,[N]
feels like they're only accelerating that.[AN]
Those pirates had those imperials dead[N]
in the skies, but just had to join in.[AN]
Can't say they differ from us and[N]
other pirates, I'll put my salt on that.[AN]
[L]
That's an illogical leap to make, Desiderio.[AN]
It did seem very reckless to them to[Beat][N]
charge into a chaotic mess like this.[AN]
But perhaps neither money nor gold[N]
were on their mind when joining in.[AN]
[FR]
Boldness like that is only going to make[N]
others bite on their heels even more![AN]
If they weren't so 'fervent' in their[N]
cause, then maybe--[AN]
[FL]
H-Hey![AN]
Miss Pilar, Mister Desiderio,[N]
can't you two settle down?[AN]
We're out of the thick of where[N]
it matters now, right?[AN]
There's no need to burst[N]
into an argument now[Beat][AN]
[R]
Razvan's right.[AN]
I'd rather not have a heated[N]
argument right after a battle.[AN]
I'm sure you two can debate[N]
these things back at port.[AN]
Calmly.[AN]
[FL][1LB]
Phew[Beat][AN]
[L][1LB]
Apologies, captain.[AN]
[FR][2LB]
Sorry about that, boss.[AN]
Mmm[Beat]maybe all this just comes[N]
from not getting what I hoped we'd get.[AN]
[Beat]Guess we were saved the trouble of[N]
cleaning up three ships, at least.[AN]
[L]
What, afraid of having to helm[N]
one of those ships alone?[AN]
I did have you take course for[N]
an hour in that merchant ship.[AN]
[FR]
[CloseEyes]And that was too damn [N]
stressful for my taste.[AN][OpenEyes]
Feel like I'd tip a bloody ship over [N]
if I helmed all by myself.[AN]
[R]
Remind me to never have you[N]
near the helm with that confidence.[AN]
Let's set sail for the port now.[AN]
At least this rescue didn't leave[N]
us completely empty-handed.[AN][X]
