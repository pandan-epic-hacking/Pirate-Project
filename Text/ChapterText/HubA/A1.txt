[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]This is the place. Desiderio,[N]
any sign of our shaman liaison?[AN]
[ML]Not that I can see. [Beat]What[N]
do we do next, Captain?[AN]
[MR]Damn, I can't stand sitting here[N]
twiddling our thumbs waiting.[AN]
Scout the perimeter, men! Let's[N]
scope our entry and exit points.[A][X]

## ChA1BeginningScene2
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]The guardhouse's outer walls[N]
are chipped in a few places.[AN]
A stiff breeze will open a path for us[N]
if we don't do the honors.[AN]
[MR]Good thing Count Sanz is as[N]
cheap as they come.[AN]
If he didn't want us to kick his walls[N]
in, he should've maintained them better.[AN]
Anything else catch your eye?[A][X]

## ChA1BeginningScene3

[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]The guardhouse connects to other[N]
buildings in the east and south.[AN]
[MR]I remember this one.[AN]
East is the Merchant Faire auction hall,[N]
and south are the nobles' quarters.[AN]
House Sanz owns the place, and they[N]
rent it out to auctioneers and bidders.[AN]
[ML]Can we get out through either?[AN]
[MR]Doubtful. The auction hall is heavily[N]
patrolled by security guards right now,[AN]
and the nobles all have personal[N]
bodyguards that'd rip us to shreds.[AN]
The only way to escape is fleeing north[N]
and losing them under cover of darkness.[AN]
[FFL]HEY![A] You two, over here![A][X]

[FL]Hello hello, Orlando's Pirates![AN]
Name's Indio Medina, a shaman[N]
from the island of Balinok.[AN]
*Huff*[Beat] *puff*[Beat] Sorry I'm late![AN]
Slow legs, and all that.[AN]
Now then, let's begin with the briefing![N]
On the east side of the guardh-[AN]
[R]You're too late, kid. We already[N]
scouted out the perimeter.[AN]
[FR]And since when were we [OpenQuote]Orlando's Pirates?[CloseQuote][N]
I'm the captain here, name's Lua.[AN]
We were told you'd fill us in on[N]
the details of Orlando's plan.[AN]
[R]Speaking of, why isn't Orlando here[N]
to give us the details himself?[AN]
Is he tied up in something?[AN]
[FL]Exactly! Orlando's role is to[N]
provide cover for this heist.[AN]
Count Sanz is notoriously paranoid[N]
about his treasure being stolen.[AN]
Orlando's job is to keep him distracted[N]
while you guys recover the relic.[AN]
[R]But the guardhouse is still[N]
heavily guarded, correct?[AN]
[FL]Yep yep! The Count's hired some mercs[N]
to bolster his regular guard regime.[AN]
We'll need to punch through them[N]
to reach the relic stored inside.[AN]
[FR]What do you mean, [OpenQuote]we?[CloseQuote][AN]
[FL]Oh, did I forget to mention that?[AN]
Orlando and the village elder gave me[N]
permission to go on this mission too![AN]
Oh! Only if it's okay with you,[N]
your captainness.[AN]
[FR][Beat][AN]
[R]Your decision, Captain Lua?[AN]
[FR]We won't look a gift shark in the mouth.[AN]
You're free to join us, Indio, but it won't[N]
be fun and games. We all pull our weight.[AN]
[FL]You got it! I'll try harder than anyone's[N]
ever tried, you can count on that![AN]
[FR]Fantastic. In that case[Beat] Desiderio,[N]
you're on babysitting duty.[AN]
[R]What?! Don't just pawn them off on me![A][X]

[ML]Our target is that northeast chest.[AN]
[MR]That's the one with your island's relic?[AN]
[ML]Yesserie! It's the most heavily guarded[N]
of the chests here, so that's the one.[AN]
[MR]We clear on the objective, men? Get[N]
that chest, [Red]then get the hell out[Red].[AN]
Steal everything that isn't nailed down,[N]
and make sure we [Red]leave no man behind[Red].[A][X]

## ChA1CarmenIndioTalkDialogue
[ML][LoadIndio][MR][LoadCarmen]
[ML]Wow! That's quite the fiddle you've got.[AN]
[MR]Aw, thank you! I'm glad someone around[N]
here can appreciate perfect craftsmanship.[AN]
It's an Arriort[ú]an, after all.[AN]
[ML]Hm? Arriort[ú]an, you say? Can I[N]
see that for just a second?[AN]
[MR][MoL]
[L][MoMR]
[ML]Oh yeah, now that I'm looking at[N]
it up close I can see that.[AN]
You see, Arriort[ú]a was an Incendivis[N]
artisan obsessed with local instruments.[AN]
He ripped off their designs, but was[N]
never able to make them sound the same.[AN]
And if you look here, you can see why.[AN]
He cheaped out on the wood and strings,[N]
making them too thin and too matted.[AN]
By chance, has the crew ever complained[N]
about the way your fiddle sounded?[AN]
[MR]Um[Beat][AN]
[ML]Oh, and it gets even worse than that.[AN]
After he retired, I heard Arriort[ú]a took up[N]
a position tutoring young nobles in magic.[AN]
Given his work on violins, I hope those poor[N]
kids unlearn his improper techniques.[AN]
[MR][Beat][AN]
[ML]Oh! Here's your instrument back.[AN]
[ML][MoR]
[R][MoML]
[ML]Sorry for taking up so much of your time.[AN]
Just between you and me, Balinokans[N]
love their gossip.[AN]
Anyway, I've got to get back to it. Maybe[N]
you can play for me sometime. See you![AN][ClearFace]
[MR][Beat]Damn it, Arriort[ú]a! It's your blasted[N]
fault nobody here appreciates my talents.[A][X]

## ChA1PilarRazvanTalkDialogue
[ML][LoadPilar][MR][LoadRazvan]
[MR]I fear I'm going to go blind from[N]
all the decadence in this room.[AN]
How can Count Sanz sleep at night[N]
when it's so bright nearby?[AN]
[ML][Beat]Soundly, I imagine.[AN]
[MR]How many people could this fortune feed?[AN]
A hundred, a thousand, maybe even a million![AN]
[ML]I think that's an exaggeration[Beat][N]
albeit, only a slight one.[AN]
[MR]What drives a man to amass such wealth?[AN]
If I were in Count Sanz's position, I'd[N]
give it all away as soon as I could![AN]
[ML]Well, that's the reason you're not in[N]
Count Sanz's position to begin with.[AN]
In this world, the people who rise to[N]
the top are those who take from others.[AN]
It's harsh, but that's life for you.[AN]
And we're pirates, we're no different.[AN]
If there's something we want, we take[N]
it without asking.[AN]
[MR][Beat][AN]
[3LB]
[ML]Okay, you're different.[A] And now that[N]
it's on the mind, what do you do with[N]
your cut of the booty from each raid?[AN]
You don't drink, you don't have any[N]
kin to send the gold to, and I've never[N]
seen you spend a cent on yourself.[AN]
Well, beyond those sickenly sweet[N]
turr[ó]ns, of course.[AN]
[2LB]
[MR]I always donate my cut to the needy.[AN]
The church will collect funds[N]
to give relief to those in need.[AN]
I'm more than full enough from[N]
the rations Captain Lua gives us,[AN]
and she always pays a tailor to[N]
mend my robes when they tear.[AN]
I could never want for anything[N]
more. To do so would be selfish.[AN]
Now then, if you don't mind, I[N]
have my duty to perform! See you![AN][ClearFace]
[ML]Maybe if we we all thought like that,[N]
the world would be a better place[Beat][A][X]

## ChA1GeraldoLeavesDialogue
[ML][LoadLeandra][MR][LoadGeraldo]
[ML]Gerry, what the hell are we doing here?[AN]
[MR]What are you talking about, Leandra?[AN]
[ML]We're being paid peanuts to stand around[N]
a dark room and watch over some boxes.[AN]
A guard said there's more gold in one[N]
chest than we'd see in our whole lives.[AN]
[MR]So? Work's work, isn't it?[AN]
[ML]That's not the point, and you know it.[AN]
You'd think a man of such wealth'd be[N]
willing to pay a little more to protect it.[AN]
[MR]Stuff it. Right now, Count Sanz is[N]
the man putting food in our bellies.[AN]
[ML]Yeah, barely. Just think, Gerry![AN]
If we took just a fraction of this[N]
room's gold, we could eat like kings![AN]
[MR]Yeah, as your last meal before[N]
they hang you for burglary.[AN]
Be thankful for this opportunity[N]
to be on the straight and narrow.[AN]
Or would you rather still be out[N]
there on the run as a pirate?[AN]
[ML][Beat][AN]
[MR]I'm gonna go do some rounds through[N]
the underground tunnels now.[AN]
Standing around here is gonna make[N]
my legs get stiff.[AN]
If you need me, just holler and I'll[N]
come up from some other staircase.[AN][ClearFace]
[ML]You're too shortsighted, Gerry.[AN]
Just think of how much we could make[N]
without licking the boots of House Sanz.[A][X]

## ChA1LuaLeandraTalkDialogue
[ML][LoadLua][MR][LoadLeandra]
[ML]Oi, sellsword. If you know what's good[N]
for you, you'll turn tail and leave now.[AN]
[MR]Oh believe me, I already know[N]
this job is no good for me.[AN]
But Count Sanz is the one paying,[N]
so he's the one I'm serving[Beat][AN]
Unless someone was willing to[N]
match his offer, I'd say.[AN]
[ML]He's holding out on you, then?[AN]
[MR]Damn straight! You know how much[N]
he's paying us for this job?[AN]
1000 gold! That's a blasted drop in[N]
the gallons of funds he makes![AN]
Just think of what I could do with[N]
his kind of luxury.[AN]
[ML][Beat][AN]
[MR]But of course, that'll have to[N]
wait until we're done here.[AN]
What's your call, lady? You gonna[N]
recognize the worth of my axe?[AN]

you the receiving end of it.[A][X]

[ML]What the- Leandra? Is that you?[AN]
[MR]Desiderio?! Are my eyes[N]
playing tricks on me?[AN]
I haven't seen you since the Roseblades.[AN]
I see you've been keeping well,[N]
plundering an armed guardhouse.[AN]
[ML]I could say the same about you, Leandra.[AN]
I thought working as a grunt for House[N]
Sanz would be beneath someone like you.[AN]
[MR]Alas, merc work is drying up these days,[N]
what with Incendivis' expansion and all.[AN]
[ML]You could never work an honest[N]
living a day in your life.[AN]
[MR]Calling the kettle black, much?[AN]
I thought you of all people would[N]
understand my situation.[AN]
[ML]It's because I do that I'm about[N]
to offer you a spot in my crew.[AN]
Captain Lua's a good woman, you'd[N]
like serving under her.[AN]
It'll be just like old times.[AN]
[MR]Old times don't pay the tab, Desiderio.[AN]
You want my services, I'll need a bit of[N]
insurance in case this job goes south.[AN]
1000 gold'll suffice.[A][X]

[3LB]
[L]Ah Orlando, have I ever told you about[N]
the Holy Stone Glyph I valiantly[N]
excavated from a decaying temple?[AN]
[MR]Multiple times, Count Sanz. In fact, the[N]
Guild's received several inquiries from[N]
linguists interested in transcribing it.[AN]
Have you considered their services?[AN]
[2LB]
[L]Bah! Not unless they're willing to pay[N]
admission to stare at my treasure.[AN]
And I doubt plebeians like them could[N]
afford my precious time, anyway.[AN]
[MR]Of[Beat] course, sir.[AN]
[L]Orlando, heed my sage advice.[N]
As a merchant, you'll understand.[AN]
Every object crafted with human hands[N]
was done in pursuit of one purpose:[AN]
to sell for a greater cost than the[N]
sum of its parts.[AN]
[MR]And did you craft the Holy Stone[N]
Glyph with your own two hands?[AN]
[L][Beat]Fine, fine, we can discuss another[N]
topic if you're sick of the Glyph.[AN]
Yurena, go into the guardhouse and find[N]
another suitable relic for Orlando.[AN]

inside the temple itself, yes![AN]
Surely you haven't retold the full[N]
extent of your heroic escapades inside.[AN]
[L]Ah, yes, gladly! So I was walking down[N]
a corridor and triggered a trapdoor.[AN]
In the heat of the moment, I bravely[N]
ordered Yurena to pull me away![AN]
[FL]That you did. What amazing self-[N]
preservation skills you have, sir.[AN]

[FL]As you command, milord.[AN]
[MR]No![AN]
[L]Sir Orlando?[AN]
[MR]Eh, it's uh - it would be dangerous to[N]

With these thieves abound, it'd be prudent[N]
to keep her by your side for safety.[AN]
[L]Gah, but they're getting away[N]
with my hard-earned treasure![AN]
[MR]No amount of gold can replace[N]
a human life, Count Sanz.[AN]
That's uh, one of the guild's creeds![AN]

[L]Ah, but I'm not going to open the door.[AN]
With the arcane power of this Warp staff[N]
I own, I can remain safe here.[AN]

Since we risked life and limb for this,[N]
mind if I ask what exactly it is?[AN]
[ML]Sure thing! It's nothing special, though.[N]
Just a depiction of our goddess, GODDESS.[AN]
[MR]Nothing special? Count Sanz was gonna[N]
sell this for a fortune at the Faire.[AN]
[ML]Oh yeah, we used to produce[N]
hundreds of these statuettes.[AN]
But since Incendivis started[N]
cracking down on rebellions,[AN]
our industries have been demolished[N]
and our relics destroyed or stolen.[AN]
Now the nobles can spin the narrative[N]
that they're rare and lost to time![AN]
Doesn't that just grind your gears,[N]
Captain?[AN]
[MR]I[Beat] suppose so, yeah.[AN]
[ML]Right? I knew you'd get it![AN]
Once we get back to port, I'll bring[N]

But hey, look on the bright side![AN]
We got the statuette back![AN]
[MR]That hardly matters now. You[N]
almost got killed getting it back![AN]
There's no way it was worth[N]
getting so heavily injured.[AN]
[ML]But it is! Incendivis destroyed so[N]
many of these statuettes over the years,[AN]
and the few remaining are being used by[N]
the nobles to jerk themselves off![AN]
Gah[Beat] ow ow ow ow ow[Beat][AN]

[MR][Beat]Whatever do you mean, sir?[AN]
[ML]Why, your reward, of course! One of[N]

You've been assisting me in hopes I[N]

Once the Guild apprehends those thugs,[N]
I'll grant you a handsome bonus![AN]
[MR]Such an offer is undeserved, sir.[AN]
However[Beat] I must show you something.[AN]
[MR][MoMR]
[MR]This flag was found among the[N]
wreckage from last night.[AN]
Based on its design: two jagged[N]
slashes to form a pitch-black heart,[AN]
the Guild reasoned it must[N]
belong to the Blackhearts.[AN]
[ML]The Blackhearts?! That can't be; the[N]
contract specifically said no looti-[AN][Clear]
I-I mean, Blackhearts who? I've never[N]
