//Hub A of Pirate Project
//Scenario: The crew arrives in Port Greagor and heads to port to sell the boat (first go-around).
//Various events occur in Port Greagor, and Hermenegildo/Estelle join you in the first run through the hub.
//Second and afterwards ones don't have the initial scene and just have hub events, changing every two chapters.

## HubATitle
Hub A - Port Greagor[X]

## HubAStatusObjective
 Explore Port Greagor[N]
 and gather doubloons.[X]

## HubAGoalWindow
Explore[X]

## HubTutorial
In Hub chapters, Lua can move freely[N]
and explore the area her crew is in.[AN]
Blue tiles indicate places she can[N]
go to change where she is at in the hub,[N]
and red tiles indicate people or places[N]
that will result in another battle.[AN]
There are various events in each area,[N]
and some may change along with the[N]
number of chapters completed.[AN]
Once all of the battles tied to a hub[N]
are completed, Lua and the crew will[N]
have one more chance to prepare,[N]
and after that, they'll move on.[AN]
For now, follow the blue tiles![A][X]

## HubAGoTime
With all of Lua's business finished,[N]
she readies to move on from Port Greagor.[AN]
Follow the green tiles to the staircase[N]
in Lua's quarters to move onto Chapter 2.[AN]
Before that, make sure you take care[N]
of any remaining business in port;[AN]
it cannot be visited again.[A][X]

[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]Ho, Lua! Let me bend your[N]
ear a wee bit longer.[AN]
[MR]Let me guess. Need me to pay[N]
off your tab again, old man?[AN]
Last I checked, my coffers were[N]
as empty as your guild's soul.[AN]
[ML]Don't take that tone with me, young woman.[AN]
If I felt like it, I could sell your crew[N]
out to the Incendivisi for a pretty penny.[AN]
[3LB]
[MR]As if. The bounty on us right now is[N]
worth jack squat compared to the booty[N]
we've raided from their ships.[AN]
[CloseSpeechSlow][2LB]
You wouldn't pass up the chance to get[N]
in on that, if only for just a sliver.[AN]
[ML]Ha! You're right - I wouldn't dream[N]
of taking the wind out of your sails.[AN]
And, as it so happens, I've got a job[N]
for you and your crew.[AN]
[MR]Spill it. You know we're not[N]
exactly built for honest work.[AN]
[ML]Did I ever take you to the Merchant's[N]
Faire back when you were under my wing?[AN]
[MR]More than once, though they all[N]
blur together as the years go by.[AN]
You taught me to count, but my head still[N]
spins for every zero beyond a million.[AN]
If you ask me, all those nobles' bidding[N]
is just them overcompensating for-[AN]
[ML]Alright, alright, save your breath[N]
for a speech I haven't heard before.[AN]
Ever heard of the island of Balinok?[AN]
[MR]Only from your mouth, when you were[N]
praising the quality of its liquor.[AN]
What do they have to do with the[N]
Merchant's Faire, and with us?[AN]
[3LB]
[ML]Well, about a week ago Incendivis got[N]
a tip that the Balinokos were harboring[N]
rebel activity.[A] They launched a raid on[N]
the islanders, and a noble from House[N]
Sanz swooped in to loot in the aftermath.[AN]
He stole some priceless relics from the[N]
island and is planning to put them up[N]
for auction during the Merchant's Faire.[AN]
[2LB]
[MR]Typical for that scum.[A] I take it your ever-so[N]
bleeding heart won't stand for this?[AN]
[ML]Damn straight![A] The Balinokan chief and I[N]
met in secret, and we made a deal.[AN]
In exchange for a lifetime supply of their[N]
lambanog, I'll recover their relic.[AN]
And your crew will be the ones to break[N]
into House Sanz's guardhouse to do it.[AN]
[MR]So you've signed us up for a dangerous[N]
job that pisses the nobles off,[AN]
all without a penny going to us.[AN]
[ML]Hey, I at least planned your[N]
payment ahead of time.[AN]
If you break into the guardhouse,[N]
you can plunder as much as you like.[AN]
Who knows just what other rarities he[N]
was planning to sell off the Faire?[AN]
So what do you say, Lua? Will you[N]
take the job?[A][X]

Orlando?[AN]
He was your old mentor, right?[.4][N]
When you were still a merchant?[AN]
[MR]
Correct--[.4]I can't say I was expecting[N]
him, but he's a welcome sight.[AN]
He'll be staying in the den for a bit,[N]
offered 5,000 gold for our prize.[AN]

Five grand for the ship?[AN]
That seems like a lowball for an entire[N]
ship[Beat][A] But I can't complain.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
I was more interested in why[N]
he was here, rather than striking[N]
out a lucrative deal.[AN]
Though, speaking of which[Beat][N]
I noticed that you didn't bring[N]
any contracts to the table this time.[AN]
Why is that?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
You've caught me red-handed.[AN]
But, that's because I have[N]
something else in mind.[AN]
A suggestion that won't[N]
deal with stingy clients.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat]I suppose it has to do with[Beat][AN]
[ML][2LB]
Sailing out to loot another ship.[AN]
Catching onto the pirate's prerogative.[.5][N]
[ToggleSmile]Good, good.[AN][Clear]
[ToggleSmile]You should know of the nearby[N]
trade route due east of the port.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
The Fairwind Corridor?[AN]
An unorthodox route for merchants--[.5][N]
It can save time, but only if you're lucky[N]
with the winds being on your side.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Indeed.[AN]
It may be less commonly used,[N]
but it's close in proximity to the port.[AN]
If we're lucky, it could only take a[N]
day to find a merchant to raid.[AN]
And I won't need the [N]
winds to see to that.[AN]
[MR]
A lucrative idea[Beat][.5][AN]
But won't there be imperial[N]
ships patrolling along the route?[AN]
The merchant vessels would be[N]
rather opulent, certainly.[AN]
However, I would rather not be thrown[N]
directly into the brig of a marine ship.[AN]
[ML]
I doubt we're infamous enough[N]
in the empire to warrant a response.[AN]
Sure, merchants should be blathering[N]
to the empire to do something about it[Beat][AN]

Desiderio, I need a second opinion[N]
on if we should take this contract.[AN]
[3LB][MR]
You're asking me? Never had to[N]
run these matters by me before.[N]
[Beat] [Beat] [Beat] [AN]
In summary, we're to go in disguised[N]
to the Blessed Isle, kill the gunsmiths[N]
for the crime of doing their trade,[AN]
then smash and grab whatever is in there.[N]
Finally, we flee into the sunset before[N]
the guards turn us into ground meat.[AN]

Essentially. What do you think?[AN]
[2LB][MR]
Doesn't say who the client is or[N]
how much the contract is worth.[AN]
[3LB][ML]
The client is me. Been planning this[N]
side project ever since news of this[N]
new weapon factory came on the wind.[AN]
As for the payment[Beat] My winnings from[N]
our last poker game? Pursestrings are[N]
rather tight from keeping us aloft.[AN]
[1LB][MR]
[Beat] 500 gold?[AN]
[2LB][ML]
They're carting over their stock as we[N]
speak, plenty of weapons worth looting.[AN]
[MR]
A little unusual, but I'd trust you over some[N]
some client who cares little for our safety.[AN]
Anyone rich enough to afford a place on[N]
the Blessed Isle deserves to be robbed.[AN]
[ML]
Ain't that the truth. Still, I can't[N]
understate how deadly the guard are.[AN]
Those wealthy elites really like staying[N]
alive, and they have gold to spare.[AN]

You ask me to jump, and I ask how[N]
high. Your perogative, Boss.[A]

No further input? Wouldn't feel right[N]

I am Rochefort, a merchant by trade.[AN]
Rumor has it your crew is looking for[N]

I'm listening. But we don't come cheap.[AN]
[3LB][MR]
Oh, I wouldn't dream of underpaying.[N]
I'll offer 10,000 gold for your troubles.[AN]
You see, I hired another crew to deliver[N]
a shipment of spices to a buyer in the[N]
inner empire, but they swindled me![AN]
The scoundrels must have thought they[N]
could profit more by selling the goods[N]
themselves than delivering them.[AN]

So you want us to retrieve[N]
this shipment for you?[AN]

Precisely! I'll tag along, of course,[N]

I imagine they'll put up some resistance,[N]

a dozen or so of them there.[AN]
Nothing you can't handle, I'm sure.[AN]

accompany us as well.[AN]
They've worked for me for quite some[N]

I suppose you two are right[Beat][N]
Well, thank you for taking care of it.[AN]
At first, I considered keeping the ship[N]

moves slowly and attracts enemies.[AN]
It would have been nice to have another[N]

It's not gonna grow any bigger until[N]

I'm not the creative sort, Desiderio.[N]

is like you trying to eat your carrots.[A]

Oh, come on, I eat my carrots just fine.[N]
It's the greens that don't go down easy[Beat][N]
But you know what the common thread is?[AN]
We may not like it, but it's good for us.[AN]
A name's something that can be feared or[N]
revered among our fellow lawbreakers,[N]
and it's the captain's job to make one.[AN]
[MR]
Bold words for someone who ran from home[N]
over not wanting to eat his vegetables[Beat][N]
Not that I believe that. Fine, you win.[AN]
I'll think of something when we get back.[AN]

[Beat]I would rather not have[N]
that experience, to be honest.[AN]
[ML]
Are you sure? I'll have plenty of gold[N]
once I sell a few of our recent scores.[AN]
Perhaps even enough for your favorite[Beat][AN]
[MR]
W-What? You couldn't mean-[.4] turr[ó]n?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Oh, I do. Almond paste, honey, and even[N]
more sugar[Beat] Thinking about it makes[N]
my teeth ache, but you're young enough.[AN]
Consider it your reward for excellent[N]
work during our expedition, Razvan.[AN]
[MR]
Captain, I[Beat] No! I won't be tempted![AN]
Thank you, truly, but I must decline.[N]
I want as little to do with pirates[N]
as possible, outside of your crew.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Fair enough, Razvan.[N]
I'll just eat it myself[Beat][AN]
[MR]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[ML]
Oh, don't look at me like that.[AN]
I'm only joking[Beat] Wait,[N]
is someone behind me?[AN]
[ML][MoL]
[FL][LoadHermenegildo][3LB]
Captain! It is oh so wonderful[N]
to see that you have returned,[N]
unharmed! Might I carry your luggage?[AN]
[L]
Oh, it's just you, Hermen.[N]
You took a long while to greet us[Beat][N]
What if we were intruders, instead?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
I-I was watching the front door,[N]
just like you told me to, captain![AN]
But, since it is so far from here,[N]
I could not hear your grand arrival.[AN]
[L]
Hm[Beat] Well, I'm satisfied that the[N]
place seems to have survived our trip.[AN]
Consider the debt reduced by a thousand[N]
doubloons for your service, Hermen.[AN]
That leaves nine thousand for you to pay[N]
to compensate the cost those Rioja Reapers[N]
demanded. All to make you a free man[Beat][AN]
A bit overpriced, if you ask me,[N]
but you're a knowledgeable fellow.[N]
You've proven yourself very useful.[AN]
[FL]
Thank you so much, c-captain![N]
I will continue to do all that I can[N]
to work off that debt, so[Beat][AN]
Might I receive a tome,[N]
to better aid you in battle?[AN]
[L][2LB]
If you want me to add it to your tab,[N]
then sure. I'll buy any tome you like.[AN]
[FL]
N-Never mind, then. I can wait until[N]
my debt is fully paid off for that.[AN]
[MR]
Mr. Hermenegildo, I'm interested[N]
in learning how to use tomes myself,[AN]
so that I'm less of a burden here[Beat][N]
Please, would you teach me your ways?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Hm. Well, learning tomelore is quite[N]
demanding, boy. I am not sure whether[N]
a child from the outskirts can learn-[AN]
[L]
That's a fine idea, Razvan. Hermen,[N]
if you agree, I'll knock two thousand[N]
off of your debt if it bears fruit.[AN]
[FL][TS]
[Beat]But you are such an intelligent lad,[N]
that I believe you can do anything![N]
With enough instruction, that is.[AN]
Come now, let us retreat to the library.[N]
I will teach you all that I learned in the[N]
capital, out of the goodness of my heart![A]
[MR][2LB]
Really? Thank you so much, sir![N]
I won't betray your faith in me.[A][CSS]
[FL][CF][MR][CF]
[L]
Ha[Beat] That blowhard cracks me up.[N]
That alone was worth the ten thousand.[AN]
Well, I'd better not delay any longer[Beat][N]

[Beat]Not an imperial guardsman in sight,[N]
sticking their nose out like pigs,[N]
and this place is all the better for it.[AN]
The guilds technically run the show,[N]
sure, but they're too busy arguing with[N]
each other to worry about any pirates.[AN]
So long as we keep things clean here[N]
and don't break any of the codes that[N]
the Greagor Five's leaders have set,[AN]
there's no better place to do business.[AN]
[Beat]Now, let me take a look at the haul.[AN]
Once I subtract all the journey's costs,[N]
the wages of my crew, and the rest[Beat][N]
I've got 7000 gold for myself.[AN]

I'd been wondering whether you got[N]
shanked on your way here, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
Come on, you know that I'm too tough[N]
for something like that to stop me.[N]
To what do I owe the pleasure, Ida?[AN]
It's not every day that the leader[N]
of the Shipwright's Guild and the[N]
Greagor Five talks to someone like me.[AN]
[ML]
I'm a busy woman, so cut the snark.[N]
An odd fellow down by the docks is[N]
looking for you, by your man[Beat][AN]
Desiderio, was it? They seem to be[N]
in some kind of dispute over something.[AN]
[MR]
An odd fellow? He must be strange indeed[N]
to appear that way to you, since you've[N]
seen all sorts of people in this port.[AN]
Thanks for letting me know, Ida.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Well, I'll be on my way.[AN]
[MR]
Ah, hold on a moment.[N]
I have a request for you.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Of course you do.[N]
Out with it, then.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
The Liberator took a beating during[N]
our last expedition. Desiderio and I[N]
can't fix it ourselves, I'm afraid,[AN]
so would you mind sending a carpenter[N]
to our cove? I'll pay well, of course.[N]
My ship is worth any price I can afford.[A]
[ML]
You better be, if I'm sending one of my[N]
people to a pirate den[Beat] Fine, I have[N]
a protege in mind who can handle it.[AN]
Pay me two thousand gold, upfront.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
A steep price[Beat] but you've never[N]
let me down before. Here you are.[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Good. A girl named Rahel will be there[N]
within the hour. A pleasure, as always.[A][X]

## HubABeginningScene3_3

That woman never smiles unless[N]
she's got gold in hand, does she?[AN]
No wonder she made it to the top.[AN]

Ah, Pilar. Any issues nearby our[N]

Didn't you hear me the first time?[N]
You're mad, woman! Get off my ship![AN]

wish, I will leave without delay.[A][X]

## HubABeginningScene4_3
[ML][LoadPilar]

Looks like that girl's trying to gain[N]
passage[Beat] Well, none of our concern.[AN]
[ML]
Unlikely, Lua.[N]
She seems to have spotted us.[AN]
[MR]
Hm[Beat] Any chance that you'll[N]
deal with it for me, Pilar?[AN]

None. You represent the crew,[N]
not me. The call is yours.[AN][X]

## HubABeginningScene4_4
[MR][LoadLua]
[L][LoadPilar]
[FL][LoadEstelle]
[MR]Let's have it, then.[N]
What do you want, girl?[A]
[FL]
Simply to ask a question, miss.[N]
Would you happen to be a pirate?[AN]
[MR]
And if I am?[AN]
[FL]
Please, let me come aboard your ship![AN]
I'll do anything that you ask of me,[N]
so long as you fulfill my wish.[AN]
[MR]
Your wish? Slow down a bit, lass.[AN]
For the right price, I might agree,[N]
but what exactly do you want?[AN]
I'm assuming it isn't just[N]
sailing the skies, right?[AN]
[FL]
[Beat]What do you think of the stars?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Well[Beat] I've passed many evening watches[N]
looking up at the stars in the sky.[N]
I imagine most sailors have.[AN]
Beyond that, I can't say I have[N]
any strong feelings about them.[N]
They're just there, always.[AN]
[FL]
I see[Beat] However, I am not satisfied[N]
merely looking up at their visage.[AN]
I desire nothing less than to visit[N]
them myself, upon an airship![AN]
Such is what I told that sailor,[N]
but he scoffed at my dream.[AN]
I was nearly about to give up hope,[N]
but I believed in my divination[N]
that a pirate would come to my aid.[AN]
And now, here you are, Miss Lua.[N]
It feels like fate, does it not?[AN]
[MR]
When did I give you my name?[N]
And[Beat] Did you say divination?[N]
As in, seeing the future?[AN]
[FL]
I know many things that I should not.[AN]
Were you to let me join your merry band,[N]
I could use my ability as you command[Beat][N]
Though I admit, it is not always reliable.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
And I admit that I'm having a hard time[N]
believing your claims, but[Beat][AN]
What do you think of them, Pilar?[AN]
[L]
It would be best not to judge from[N]
the lens of one raised in the Empire.[AN]
Out in these isles, and even beyond,[N]
the impossible can become very real[Beat][AN]
[L]
[MR][1LB]
Hm[Beat] What's your name, lass?[AN]
[ML]
You may call me Estelle.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
To tell you the truth, I have no idea[N]
how to sail an airship that far up.[N]
Anyone that's tried has crashed first.[AN]
If you still want to join us knowing that,[N]
then I'll let you, on one condition.[AN]
You'll have to pull your own weight,[N]
with or without your divinations.[N]
Pilar, can you show her the ropes?[A]
[L]
Of course. Listen to me, Estelle.[N]
The captain may doubt your goals,[N]
but anything can happen in this world.[AN]
Many of the outer isles still remain[N]
unexplored[Beat] Perhaps even one similar[N]
to your dream lies waiting for you.[AN]
But to get there, you'll need to work[N]
for it. Nothing comes easy when you're[N]
a crewmate on the Liberator, understand?[AN]
[FL]
Of course. Thank you so much, Miss Pilar![N]
And you as well, Miss[Beat] Captain Lua![AN]
I promise that I will be of service.[N]
In fact, I had payment in mind, but[Beat][N][MoFL][MoFL]
Oh, I just cannot find it anywhere![AN]
[MR][ToggleSmile]
Well, you'll pay plenty in elbow grease.[N]
I've got some business to take care of,[N]
but welcome to the crew, Estelle.[AN]
[FL][2LB]
Y-Yes. Thank you again![A][X]

I'm not gonna sell you this boat[N]

[FFL][LoadOrlando]
Oh? But what if I decide to purchase[N]
another, instead? I suspect your[N]
captain would be quite furious.[AN]
[FFR]
She might be, true, but she'd put me[N]
in shackles if I did what you want.[N]
I'll take some mean words over that.[AN]
[FFL]
Oh, you exaggerate far too much.[N]
Your captain and I go way back,[N]
and she was never a cruel mistress.[AN]

it would only last a day, at most![AN]
Surely that much is worth my coin?[AN][X]

so you gotta tell him[Beat] Boss?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]What are you doing here, Orlando?[N]
This is no place for a man like you.[AN]
[ML]
Oh, you flatter me, Lua.[AN]
I was just looking for you,[N]
so I'm glad you showed up.[AN]
[FR]
It wasn't a compliment.[AN]
[R]
Uh, mind filling me in?[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]The short of it is that he's[N]

His name is Orlando Felicitas,[N]

I'm quite a bit more than a dog now,[N]

that you were one of us, as well.[AN]
[FR]
[Beat]Enough. You wouldn't come this far[N]
for pleasantries. What do you want?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I hoped that we could discuss old times[N]
and what brought you to these lawless[N]
isles. Perhaps over drinks, like always?[AN]
Ah, but such talk should be discreet.[N]
No disrespect to your servant here,[N]
but I don't trust him as I do you.[AN]
[R]
Servant? You've got the wrong idea, pal.[N]
I may be Lua's right hand, but I serve[N]
out of choice, not an obligation.[AN]
So, even if you're her old buddy,[N]
if you think you can disrespect me,[N]
I've got a fist with your name-[AN]
[FR]
Desiderio, don't! He's not worth it.[AN]
[Beat]You're as incomprehensible as always,[N]

I have my own quarters back at my base.[AN]
But you're only coming as a potential[N]

has eyes in the back of her head.[AN]
But worry not, I will refrain.[N]
Is that girl in your employ?[AN]

Never seen her in my life,[N]
so she must be one of Ida's.[AN]

You[Beat] You match Master Ida's[N]
description of the captain.[AN]
Can you tell this goon to let[N]

[Beat]If I have to give you that,[N]

Ida's apprentice and all.[AN]

so don't disturb me anymore.[A][CSSCF]

## HubABeginningScene6_2
[ML][LoadOrlando]
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Take a seat wherever you like, and[N]
let's get down to business, Orlando.[N]
Tell me why you're really here.[AN]
[ML]
Oh? Well, for starters, I would like[N]
to purchase that merchant galleon.[N]
Say[Beat] For five thousand gold, perhaps?[AN]
You could sell it a bit higher,[N]
but any observant individual will notice[N]
its[Beat] former uses, and ask questions.[AN]
[MR]
Seems like a fair price to me.[N]
But I asked why you're really here,[N]
and that isn't the answer, is it?[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Sharp as always. To tell the truth,[N]
I heard tales of a swashbuckling pirate[N]
captain targeting merchants recently.[AN][ToggleSmile]
But not just any merchants, mind you.[N]
Reports say she targeted those deep[N]
in bed with the Imperial Marines.[AN]
When I think of pirates, I typically[N]
do not imagine them choosy about their[N]
targets, let alone as selective as that.[AN]
Well, perhaps one with a grievance[Beat][AN]
[MR][1LB]
So you thought of me?[A]
[ML][3LB]
Admittedly a bit of a reach,[N]
but I've always enjoyed a gamble.[N]
In any case, I come on guild business.[AN]
Your absence the past few months greatly[N]
impacted our operations, says the chief.[N]
He asked that you return to the fold.[AN]
[MR][1LB]
No.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
And I told him you would say that.[N]
Well, at least I tried, eh?[AN]
I have to admit that I was surprised[N]
when I saw you. In only a few months,[N]
you have become quite the pirate, Lua.[AN]
[Beat]Is it because of that tragedy?[AN]
[MR]
That was only the trigger, Orlando.[AN]
The thievery of my wares, and the refusal[N]
of the marines to save me from ruin[Beat][N]
Only a prelude that showed me the truth.[AN]
The empire is built on a house of cards,[N]
propped up by the wealth of the few[N]
and the tyranny of the marines.[AN]
But here, I'm free for once in my life.[N]
I don't plan on ever going back.[AN]
[ML]
I sympathize with your position, Lua,[N]
but are you truly satisfied with this?[AN]
The pirates in bedtime stories journey[N]
on grand adventures and find great[N]
treasure. But you[Beat] hunt merchants?[AN]
[MR][1LB]
What are you getting at?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
As it happens, quite a few interesting[N]
occurrences have manifested, as of late.[AN]
All related to mysterious movements[N]
of the Imperial Marines that you hate,[N]
in the direction of these very isles,[AN]
and further. It is rare enough to see[N]
a marine vessel out in these parts[Beat][N]
But as many as the rumors say?[AN]
They seek something, Lua.[N]
Perhaps even[Beat] the Fire Emblem.[A]
[MR]
Not this again, Orlando. The idea that[N]
some magical artifact raised these isles[N]
into the skies is completely absurd.[AN]
It's something I'd expect from a drunkard[N]
at the tavern, not from a top merchant.[AN]
[ML]
Oh, am I not allowed to dream?[AN]
At the very least, those marines[N]
are searching for something valuable[N]
in lands fraught with mystery.[AN]
Does that not excite your spirit?[N]
Would you not like to steal it,[N]
right from under their noses?[AN]
[MR]
I get the idea, so shut it already.[AN]
[Beat]I'll have to ask the crew and mull[N]
it over before deciding whether we[N]
should go further into the outskirts.[AN]
We'll need more crewmates anyway,[N]
and the coin to pay and feed them.[AN]
[ML]
Take all the time you like.[N]
I can provide coin, so long as you[N]
help me in return with my lodging.[AN]
[MR]
I doubt they're what you're used to,[N]
but I've got a few empty rooms down[N]
in the basement. Take your pick.[AN]
[ML]
If those are the best accomodations,[N]
then I suppose that is good enough.[AN]
It will take some time to unpack,[N]
so we can stop here for now, Lua.[N]
Please, give my words some thought.[AN][CSSCF]
[MR]
It's rare for him to stop talking[N]
voluntarily[Beat] Well, whatever.[AN]
He's got a point that things have[N]
gotten boring around here lately,[N]
so a change of pace might be good.[AN]
For now though, I should snoop[N]
around the port, expand the crew,[N]
and grab whatever gold I can find.[AN]
[Beat]And think of that damned name.[A][X]

If she got away with that if[N]
you were sober...[A] *sigh*[.4][AN]
[CloseEyes]I'm afraid what she'd be[N]
able to do in your condition.[AN][OpenEyes]
Alright, c'mon, no more drinking,[N]
I'll get you some bread and water.[AN]

Grrrrgh[Beat]fine, alright[Beat][AN]

Fine, fine, I'll test your might with it.[AN]
But not now, I'm afraid you'd fall[N]

Tsk...though I doubt it could even[N]
pierce through a piece of paper.[AN][X]

[R]Heave, Carmen! This ship[N]
won't unload itself![AN]
[L]Ugh, such menial work as this[N]
is beneath one of my station.[AN]
I'd be of much more use serenading[N]
you from the sidelines while you work.[AN]
[R]Do what you will. Just know the[N]
captain's paying us by the crate.[AN]
You play your fiddle, I'll be happy[N]
to pick up your slack of the work.[AN]
[L]Tsk, artless fool[Beat][AN][CSS]
[FL][LoadLua]
[L]Captain! Please, you must understand[N]
I'm not cut out for such heavy labor.[AN]
I was built for softer things in life:[N]
fluffy pillows, an emperor-sized bed.[AN]
[FL]You want a softer bedrest, I'd[N]
be happy to toss you overboard.[AN]
Let you sleep with the fishies,[N]
I heard they're very nice.[AN]
[L]Guh! F-fine, I'll get back to work.[AN]
But one day, you and this entire[N]
crew will work as my servants![AN]
[R]Yeah, and I'm the Pirate King.[AN]
Anyway, we're almost done unloading[N]
the ship's cargo, captain.[AN]
What's our next task?[AN]
[FL]Nothing comes to mind. Take a load off,[N]
you two've earned it.[A] Well, one of you.[AN]
[L]Hey! I did my share of the work![AN]
[R]Yeah, yeah, sure.[AN]
Hey Carmen, want to come with me[N]
to the tavern once we're done?[AN]
Maybe the barkeep'll let you play[N]
your fiddle as entertainment.[AN]
If you're lucky, you'll get a few[N]
pity doubloons tossed your way.[AN]
[L]I'll make you eat those words, Ximo.[N]
How about a bet?[AN]
If I make more in tips tonight than[N]
you did in wages, you pay for drinks.[AN]
[R]I don't make bets I can't win.[N]
You're on, mage girl.[A][X]

[L][LoadRazvan][R][LoadHermenegildo]
[R]A-and so it's rumored that the ink used[N]
to pen tomes came from the Lands Below.[AN]
While such asinine claims have since[N]
been debunked, it is no less importa-[AN]
[L]Master Hermenegildo, with all due respect,[N]
when can I see a magical demonstration?[AN]
If I'm to one day cast tomes for myself,[N]
I want to see them used practically.[AN]
[R]As soon as I get my hands on one![AN]
If you must blame anyone, blame your[N]
cheapskate captain who won't pay f-[AN]
[FL][LoadLua]
[FL][Beat]Finish your sentence, Hermen.[AN]
I was just on my way here to[N]
check on your tutoring status.[AN]
Razvan, how's your progress?[AN]
[L]Captain Lua! Master Hermenegildo spent[N]
the last hour lecturing me on history.[AN]
If it's not too much a bother, I want[N]
to start casting tomes as soon as I can.[AN]
[R]Patience, child. You- you have to grasp[N]
the fundamentals first! Yes, that's it![AN]
Although certainly, I wouldn't complain[N]
if the captain wanted to cover the cost.[AN]
[FL]I seem to recall a Light Brand in your[N]
possession when we dragged you in.[AN]
[R]M-my trusty Light Brand? But it's the[N]
only artifact legally belonging to me![AN]
Its mana is wasted on - party tricks[N]
for a frivolous student to gawk at![AN]
[L]Excuse me?[AN]
[R]Gah! I mean- I, I mean I'd be glad to[N]
use the Light Brand as an example![AN]
Eternal thanks for reminding me, Captain,[N]
I'm forever in your debt![AN]
[FL]Keep up that attitude and you just[N]
might be.[AN]
Now, I have other business to attend to.[AN]
Razvan, let me know whenever you feel[N]
experienced enough to pick up a tome.[AN]
I'll gladly pay out of pocket for it.[AN]
[L]Thank you so much, Captain![AN]
[FL]And Hermen.[AN]
If Razvan reports to me that he made[N]
progress after today's lecture[Beat][AN]
200 gold off your debt in advance.[AN]

too kind, Captain![A][X]

[R]Oho! To what do I owe the pleasure, Lua?[AN]
[FL]Just passing through. There's a lot[N]
of people to speak to around here.[AN]
[R]Ha! Isn't that the truth.[N]
Wouldn't you say, Rahel?[AN]
[L]Sure.[AN]
[FL]Don't humor him with a response, Rahel.[AN]
He'll stop talking if he doesn't get[N]
a reaction out of you.[AN]
[R]Ha! Isn't that the truth.[AN]
[FL][Beat]Anyway, how's progress on the ship?[AN]
Ida sent you alone, she must have[N]
high faith in your abilities.[AN]
[L]Steady. And sure, you could say that.[AN]
Now leave me alone, you're disturbing[N]
my work.[AN]
[FL]That's slightly uncalled for. And wait,[N]
how I am disturbing you when he isn't?[AN]
[R]What can I say? My silver tongue[N]
makes for golden conversation.[AN]
A skill you could've stood to[N]
pick up in your apprenticeship.[AN]
[FL]Stuff it, old man.[AN]
[L][Beat]It's 'cause I have to actually pay[N]
attention to what you say, captain.[AN]
With this windbag, I can have his[N]
words go in one ear and out the other.[AN]
Now stop talking, I can't work when[N]
I'm trying to pick apart voices.[AN]
[FL][Beat]Should I apologize for that?[AN]
[R]Creed 7 of the Merchant's Guild:[N]
never apologize for being yourself.[AN]

[L]The hell?! Say that again, woman![AN]
[FL]Desiderio! I could hear you from the[N]
Lands Below. What's going on here?[AN]
[L]This boatsmith's got a mind to[N]
kick us out of the damn port.[AN]
[FL]I thought we agreed to terms, Ida.[AN]
We'd contract your guild, lie low[N]
a few weeks, then sail on.[AN]
[R]That's too long a time, Lua.[N]
Incendivis just gave out an order:[AN]
all ports and merchants harboring[N]
dissidents will be TORCHed.[AN]
[FL]Is that it? You're scared of[N]
a few measly imperials?[AN]
[R]If you had to deal with them, you'd[N]
be running for your damn lives.[AN]
You hear about the Roseblades?[N]
I know your quartermaster does.[AN]
[L]I'll fill in the story, captain.[AN]
When Rogelio sold out the Roseblades[N]
seven years ago, he sold out everyone.[AN]
Every port and merchant who helped[N]
us was put to the torch.[AN]
Burned to the ground: no trial, no[N]
negotiation, nothing left behind.[AN]
[R]He has the right of it.[AN]
I built up the Greagor Five[N]
with my own two hands.[AN]
I'm not losing it to T.O.R.C.H.[N]
'cause of the likes of you:[AN]
a band of wet-behind-the-ears[N]
pirates without any sense.[AN]
[FL]In simpler terms, you want us to[N]
leave before we draw T.O.R.C.H. here.[AN]
[R]I want to support you, I really do.[AN]
But for the sake of my port, I can't[N]
take any chances, no matter how small.[AN]
Hell, I'm still not comfortable sending[N]
Rahel down to your damn pirate lair.[AN]
[FL]And I certainly am grateful for that.[AN]
We'll not overstay our welcome, we just[N]
need a few weeks to settle our affairs.[AN]

[R]Well, I-[AN]
[L]Bad. It's going bad.[AN]
[R]I cannot deny that.[AN]
[L]She's too caught up in her dream to see[N]
the stars that she lacks fundamentals.[AN]
Ships don't fly with wishful thinking.[AN]
[R]But, you understand, my divination[N]
revealed I could see them with your help.[AN]
That is all I need believe in.[AN]
[L]Yeah, if you want to earn a one-way[N]
ticket down to the Lands Below.[AN]
Which last I asked, wasn't your dream.[AN]
[FL]Unless your divination taught[N]
you how to tell stem from stern,[AN]
listen to Pilar.[A] She's the best[N]
navigator this side of the Empire.[AN]
And, more importantly, she wants[N]
to help you achieve your dream.[AN]
[R]Of[Beat] of course, my captain.[N]
I apologize for my indiscretion.[AN]
[L]No, no, stop your apologies.[N]
Here, take this.[AN]
[R]A dusty book?[AN]
[L]Penned by my old master. It's a record[N]
of all the stars in the night sky.[AN]
When I was a wee lass, this was how[N]
sailors navigated the skies.[AN]
Given your intense interest in the[N]
stars, I'd like you to have this.[AN]
[R]You mean it? Thank you so[N]
much, Master Pilar![AN]
I'll study hard and be ready[N]
to steer by the day's end.[AN]
[L]I'd like to see that.[AN]
[R][CF]
[L]Is this what the youngsters[N]
are like these days, Lua?[AN]
[FL]I know as much as you do[N]
about today's youth, Pilar.[AN]
But if they're like Estelle,[N]
I think we're in good hands.[A][X]

// Lua says that all the work's dried up, and they've spent enough time in Port Greagor: She orders the crew to head back to base and wait for her there.

[Beat]That seems like enough odd jobs.[AN]
Not all of them went as I'd hoped,[N]

But what to do with it?[AN]
Orlando's claims about the Imperial[N]

do smell like an opportunity,[AN]
but with large gains come equal risks.[AN]
I'll have to raise the issue with[N]

once the ship's repairs are done.[AN]

Whether there's a Fire Emblem in the[N]

things have gotten stale around here.[AN]
A bit of adventure will do me good.[N]
