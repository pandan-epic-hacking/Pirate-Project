// Ondeh and Biko want to find a hidden treasure, but they need help.
// Ondeh owes a debt to a group of pirates, and she can't pay them back.

// At the tomb, the treasure turns out to be a sham, only a few logs in the tomb.
// The pirates show up and reveal it was a trap.
// The group escapes. After their exit, Lua tells Ondeh the debt is now transferred to her. And now it is absolved.
// Ondeh says she'll work to repay Lua's kindness. Biko agrees too.

I can hear the river.[N]
[Beat] We're getting close.[N]
Keep up the pace.[AN]

[FarLeft][LoadBiko]
[Left]
Tell that to your brother.[N]
This young man looks like he[N]
is about to keel over.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[CloseEyes]Grooooaaagghhh[Beat][N]
Ondeh[Beat] I need to take a break.[N]
[OpenEyes]My legs are almost jelly[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
Once we get the treasure, you[N]
can have all of the fruit preserves[N]
you wish. I'll buy you your favorite.[AN]
[Left]
Doesn't sound like a bad deal, kid.[N]
My crew is right behind.[N]
Let's not waste time.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Don't listen to her honeyed words,[N]
Captain[Beat] She'll just work you[N]
harder like she always does.[AN]
[MidRight]
You need to work to make it in this world.[N]
Not everyone has an older sister to[N]
spoonfeed them boysenberry jam.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Boysenberry[Beat] Dang it, Biko.[N]
Fine, fine, let's keep moving.[N]
A proper rest can wait.[AN]
[Left]
Glad you two could work out a deal.[N]
I know a merchant who knows a purveyor[N]
of fine jams, jellies, and preserves.[AN]
If this job goes well, perhaps I can[N]
arrange an introduction. No doubt they'd[N]
appreciate a new, loyal client.[AN]
[FarLeft]
[2LB]
Purveyor of jams?[N]
Like those artisinal ones?[AN]
[Left]
Fine fruits, rare fruits.[N]
Expert craftsmanship, I'd add.[AN]
[FarLeft]
You know, I'm suddenly feeling[N]
a lot better about all this.[AN]
Ondeh, Miss Lua, you both should[N]
follow me. Here we go![AN]

[3LB]
Purveyor of fine jams?[N]
I've never heard of such an occupation.[N]
But thank you for giving him a nudge.[AN]
You picked up what I was going for quickly.[N]
The only thing to stop him from loafing[N]
is to offer him dessert, I'm afraid.[AN]
[Left]
I made it up.[N]
I don't want to waste time[N]
in this jungle either.[AN]
[MidRight]
[1LB]
[Beat] I agree. Let's go.[A][X]

So, this is the tomb[N]
of San Torino.[AN]
For all of the bluster about[N]
it being so well-hidden,[AN]
I'm surprised we found it[N]
without much trouble.[AN]
[FarRight]
And San Torino was nice enough[N]
to leave the door open for us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[3LB]
Don't let an inviting entrance[N]
let your guard down.[N]
Consider this:[AN]
Finding your way here may be simple,[N]
but getting back is the hard part.[AN]
Places found by the dead[N]
are typically those that[N]
are hidden to the living.[AN]
Take caution.[A][X]

This is it? It's so small.[AN]
I thought you said she was[N]
some sort of king buried[N]
with a litter of cats.[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
So the legend goes at least.[N]
It's probably embellished.[AN]
[Right]
There's a plaque. It looks[N]
a bit worn[Beat][AN]
[OpenQuote]Here lies San Torino,[N]
the woman king of Pellegrino.[AN]
Her treasures scattered in the jungle,[N]
the truth revealed only by wooden key.[CloseQuote][AN]

So this is just an altar.[N]

The Rioja Reapers[Beat] They followed us.[AN]

This smells like a set up to me.[N]
You have five seconds to convince[N]
me otherwise. Talk. Now.[AN]
[Right]
We're not setting you up[Beat][N]
I swear it on my mother's grave.[N]
We owe these men a debt.[AN]
I heard rumors of a treasure.[N]
If I could get even a fraction of its[N]
value, I could pay them off[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft]
I'll choose to believe you for now.[N]
Any funny business and you're both dead.[N]

Oh no, I don't think San Torino[N]
likes us fighting out here[Beat][AN]

[CloseEyes]Last thing we need is a damned specter[N]
appearing and haunting us all.[AN][X]

So, you're in bed with this[N]
sorry lot as well?[AN]
Maybe this time can offer[N]
you buy-one-get-one-free.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadHermenegildo]
Milking me for coin may have[N]
been your gravest mistake.[AN]
A poetic ending for you,[N]
don't you agree?[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
Cease this fairytale nonsense.[N]
You will grovel to me![A][X]

## A3_BossQuote_Biko

Brat with a spear, eh?[AN]
You should be pointing[AN]
it at your sister.[AN]
She got you in this mess, kid.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadBiko]
No[Beat] Ondeh was deceived.[N]
We shouldn't have trusted you.[AN]
I will never betray my sister![A][X]

## A3_BossQuote_Ondeh
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
Thanks for leading us here,[N]
wench. Your debt's repaid.[AN]
Just hand over the treasure.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadOndeh]
If that's all it took, why take[N]
an army to track us down?[AN]
Surely you didn't come here[N]
to negotiate.[AN]
I know better than to trust[N]
your kind now.[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
Strong words from a doxy.[AN]
Back in my day,[N]
they didn't talk back.[AN]
Looks like I'll need to put[N]
you in your place.[AN]
A shame[Beat][AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadOndeh]
I worked hard to[N]
pay off my debt.[AN]
You terrorized us[N]
at every turn anyway.[AN]
No matter what we offered,[N]
you still wanted more[Beat][AN]
I see now you never intended[N]
to spare us, even after this.[AN]
I've learned a[N]
difficult lesson[Beat][AN]
But I won't make[N]
that mistake again.[A][X]

## A3_BossQuote_Lua
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
Ah, Captain Lua![AN]
Sorry I didn't[N]
bring any wares.[AN]
I don't have any groveling[N]
men on the shelf today.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
I think I'm piecing[N]
this together.[AN]
You tricked that girl,[N]
didn't you?[AN]
Offered her a debt she could[N]
never repay, is that right?[AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
For someone who rubs elbows[N]
with sorry men and naive girls,[AN]
your eye is more keen[N]
than I'd come to expect.[AN]
You'd do well in the Reapers,[N]
reporting to me, of course.[AN]
It is a shame we crossed[N]
paths like this.[AN]
[MidLeft][ClearFace]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
Keep dreaming.[N]
I work for myself now.[AN]
And I'd certainly never[N]
bend the knee to a dastard.[AN]
Selling men and terrorizing[N]
women is the stuff of cowards.[AN]
To sink so low would fill[N]
with me unimaginable shame[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
Keep squawking about morals.[N]
I'm not here for a lecture.[AN]
Raise your blade, wench.[N]
I'll make quick work of this.[A][X]

## A3_BossQuote_All
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
I am Sagargala, the Sky[N]
Narwhal! Be at ease![AN]

## A3SagargalaDeathQuote
[MidLeft][LoadSagargala]
Losing to women and babes[Beat][N]
What a humiliating defeat.[AN]
But this isn't the end[N]
for the Rioja Reapers.[AN]
The captain will find you,[N]
hear me? You'll all[Beat] pay[Beat][A][X]

[FarRight][LoadBiko]
[Right][LoadOndeh]
So it was all a sham.[N]
They led us here to kill us.[AN]
Goaded us to step to our deaths.[N]
Captain Lua, if not for you[Beat][AN]
We would both be dead.[N]
For that, I am grateful.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Don't bend your knee, Ondeh.[N]
It's that attitude[N]
that got you in trouble.[AN]
At the very least,[N]
I know you didn't set us up,[N]
so consider yourselves spared.[AN]
However, debt doesn't get washed[N]
away with a man's death.[AN]
Whatever you owe is now[N]
owed to me instead.[AN]
[Right][2LB]
[Beat] Very well.[N]
It's an amount of-[AN]
[MidLeft]
Peace. Let's say this.[N]
I consider your debt canceled.[AN]
You owe me nothing more.[N]
You're free to do as you please.[AN]
[FarRight]
Y-you're being for real, Captain?[N]
Thank you! This is great![AN]
[Right]
Quiet, Biko.[AN]
Captain Lua[Beat][N]
I appreciate your kindess.[AN]
[MidLeft]
However, I would instead[N]
offer you both employment.[AN]
You each proved your worth today,[N]
and I know you'll be good for our crew.[AN]
We can arrange a proper contract.[N]
What do you both say?[AN]
[FarRight]
I think we should do it, Ondeh.[N]
Captain Lua seems honorable.[AN]
[Right]
It's true. She could've left us for dead[N]
and turned us over to the Reapers.[AN]
Instead, she chose to save us[Beat][N]
Captain Lua[Beat] I accept.[AN]
I will serve your crew honorably.[N]
I trust you'll find use for us.[AN]
[MidLeft]
Excellent. Welcome aboard.[N]
Now then, let's head back to Port.[A][X]
