[MR][LoadRazvan]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat]Port Receloso, huh?[A]
[ML][2LB]
I've seen the name on charts before.[N]
Quiet place, out here. Ill-guarded.[A][N]
Even pirates don't think[N]
it has much to offer.[A]
[MR]
Yeah. That sounds about right.[A][N]
And it's what feels a bit[N]
uncomfortable about going there.[A]
[ML][1LB]
Uncomfortable? It's just a town.[A]
[MR][2LB]
I grew up in a town[Beat][N]
a lot like that.[A][N]
Poor and hopeless, too[N]
barren even for pirates,[A][N]
far from Imperial law.[A]
[ML]
[ToggleSmile]Far away from the Empire?[N]
Sounds like paradise to me.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]But I'll take your word for it.[A]
[MR]
It wasn't.[AN]
There was nothing there.[A][N]
I left to go make something[N]
of myself, to better the world.[A][N]
And now it's almost[N]
like I'm coming back[Beat][A][N]
[CloseEyes]having become a pirate. Having[N]
become whoever I am now[Beat][A][OpenEyes]
[MR][MoR]
[FR][LoadLua]
[FR]
Well, we've arrived. No more[N]
point in reminiscing now.[A][N]
[Beat]Hm? Looks like someone down[N]
there's calling out to us.[A][N]
Asking us to land, so we can talk.[A]
[ML]
Could be an Imperial trap,[N]
luring us into an ambush.[A]
[FR]
Maybe.[AN]
Pilar, get the crew readied[N]
and armed, just in case.[A][X]


## B2a_OnDocks
[FarLeft][LoadPilar]
[Left][LoadLua]
[MidRight][LoadMagdalena]
[MidRight]
Are you the captain of[N]
this, er, armada of ships?[A]
[Left]
[Beat]Indeed I am.[AN]
We've landed just to[N]
purchase food and timber.[A][N]
If you've no quarrel with[N]
us, we've none with you.[A]
[MidRight]
A noble captain, from[Beat][N]
the Empire, I presume.[A]
[FarLeft][1LB]
[Beat][A]
[MidRight][2LB]
In that case, then I[Beat][N]
I would request your assistance.[A]
[Left]
Do you mean as payment?[N]
And assistance with what, exactly?[A]
[MidRight]
Since its founding, Port Receloso[N]
has been a quiet, peaceful place.[A][N]
Yet recently, in the last few weeks[Beat][N]
several of its citizens have[N]
been found dead.[A] [Beat]Murdered.[A]
[FarLeft]
How tragic. And that[N]
concerns us how, exactly?[A]
[Left][1LB]
Pilar![A]
[FarLeft][2LB]
It's a legitimate question.[A][N]
She's yet to explain. Or to[N]
introduce herself, for that matter.[A]
[MidRight]
I[Beat] suppose I have[N]
forgotten. I am sorry.[A][N]
My name is Lady Magdalena, and I[N]
am the one who governs this port.[A][N]
I would ask you[Beat] to help[N]
me investigate these murders,[A][N]
and find who it is who has[N]
brought violence to this town.[A]
[Left]
[Beat]We can't.[A][N]
My crew isn't detectives - just[N]
everyday sailors and soldiers.[A][N]
And we have a mission that[N]
can't brook delays like this.[A]
[FarLeft]
Just take our coin, give us our[N]
supplies, and we'll be on our way.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I am afraid I cannot give[N]
you a choice in that regard.[A][N]
No ship may leave this port[N]
until the killer is found[Beat][A][N]
so they cannot escape.[A][N]
If you will not find this murderer,[A][N]
then you must simply wait[N]
until they come to the light.[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]I was afraid[N]
it'd come to this.[A][N]
Seems we'll have to fight[N]
our way out after all, Captain.[A]
[Left][3LB]
[Beat]Hold on a moment.[A][N]
Lady Magdalena, you don't actually[N]
have the power to compel us[N]
to do anything for you.[A]
[MidRight][1LB]
[Beat]
[Left][2LB]
We've an armada of multiple ships,[N]
and a whole crew of trained fighters.[A][N]
You've just yourself and[N]
a couple ragtag militiamen.[A][N]
Even if you have more[N]
forces lying in wait,[A][N]
we'd be a distant speck before[N]
they even reach the docks.[A][N]
Sure you want to press this issue?[A]
[FarLeft][ClearFace]
[FarLeft][LoadRazvan]
[FarLeft]
Captain[Beat] we should help[N]
Lady Magdalena and stay.[A]
[Left]
You know what's coming for us[N]
if we wait in a port like this.[A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]I do.[A][N]
But still, it's[Beat] just[N]
the right thing to do.[A][N]
These are innocent villagers, in[N]
danger because of this murderer.[A][N]
We can't just stand by and do nothing.[A]
[Left]
Who says we can't?[A][N]
We don't live in Port Receloso.[N]
Its problems aren't ours.[A]
[FarLeft]
Maybe not. But still, we[N]
should at least care.[A][N]
If we leave this town to its suffering,[A][N]
then we're hardly better than[N]
T.O.R.C.H. or the Blackhearts.[A][N]
Just another boat full of[N]
killers in the skies.[A][N]
But, here[Beat][A][N]
we at least have a chance to do[N]
something we both know is right.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat]I will state it.[A][N]
If you can find and stop the[N]
murderer who stalks Port Receloso,[A][N]
then I will give to you[N]
whatever supplies you need,[A][N]
without demanding even a[N]
single doubloon in recompense.[A][N]
Your service will be enough.[A]
[Left]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]Fine.[A][N]
We'll put this killer in a gaol,[N]
then fill our hold and leave.[A][N]
Are you two satisfied?[A]
[FarLeft][1LB]
[Beat]Thank you, Captain Lua.[A]
[MidRight][2LB]
I am thankful, truly thankful,[N]
for your assistance.[A][N]
Now, if you would follow[N]
me farther into town[Beat][A]
[Left]
Don't test my patience,[N]
Lady Magdalena.[A]
[MidRight][1LB]
I would not dream of it.[A][X]

[MR][LoadMagdalena]
[ML]
Well, we're here. All the[N]
townsfolk certainly look agitated.[A]
[MR]
Yes[Beat] these murders have[N]
been painful to all of us.[A][N]
The most recent death was[N]
our priest, Father Gavriel[Beat][A][N]
he was found stabbed to[N]
death in our church,[A][N]
up on the north end of[N]
town, just two days ago.[A]
[ML]
And what exactly do[N]
you need me to do?[A]
[MR]
While the townsfolk have varied opinions,[AN]
suspicions have settled in[N]
particular on three poor souls.[A][N]
Husniye, a petty thief[Beat][A][X]

Good Captain[Beat][A][N]
Please, wander the streets.[N]
Speak to the people.[A][N]
Gather their tales,[N]
theories, testimonies.[A][N]
And when you have come[N]
to your final conclusion[Beat][A][N]
bring your answer of[N]
who to arrest to me.[A]
[ML][1LB]
Why not just arrest all three?[A]
[MR]
[Beat]I have not the strength.[A]
[ML]
Hm?[A]
[MR][2LB]
Neither to investigate, nor to accuse.[A][N]
I[Beat] cannot bring myself to levy threats[N]
and chains against the people of my town.[A][N]
Not unless, through the[N]
wisdom of one like you,[A][N]
I know them to be[Beat] guilty.[A]
[ML]
You're too scared to[N]
arrest murder suspects,[A][N]
but you're fine with just[N]
press-ganging me into investigating?[A]
[MR]
You are a stranger,[N]
while the three suspects[Beat][A][N]
they are my people.[A][N]
That difference means[N]
everything to me, in the end[Beat][A]
[ML]
[Beat]Very well.[A][N]
I'd best start doing[N]
some investigation, then.[A][X]


## B2a_MechanicalExplanation
In this chapter, you will[N]
explore Port Receloso and[N]
talk to its citizens.[AN]
Like the hub segments of[N]
Port Greagor and the armada,[AN]
there will not be combat, and[N]
Lua may take turns freely.[AN]
However, there may be more to do[N]
after solving the murder before[N]
returning to the armada...[A][X]

That pirate, and Lady Magdalena[Beat][N]
Have you come to shame me further?[A]
[Left]
No. We've come to[N]

I[Beat] have no wish to[N]

but you cannot be[N]

I don't know what happened[N]
between you and Gavriel,[A][N]
but the town needs justice.[A]
[MidRight]
I thought you, at least,[A][N]
could be different[Beat][N]
a fellow foreigner[Beat][A][N]
but you despise me[N]
just like all the rest![A][N]
This is no [OpenQuote]justice"![A]
[FarLeft]
It is.[A][N]
You cheated, you stole,[N]
and now, you killed[Beat][A][N]
Husniye, you must pay the price.[A]
[MidRight][3LB]
I did nothing![A][N]
I gave this port my[N]
life, my soul, my love,[N]
and you all still hate me![A][N]
Put me down![N]
PUT[A] ME[A] DOWN![A]
[Left][2LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Be quiet. It'll[N]
go easier that way.[A]
[FarLeft]
Though it makes for[N]

there is a spare room[N]

You were the man who murdered[N]
Father Gavriel, were you not?[A]

[Beat]ha[Beat] hahahaha![A]
[Left][2LB]
What's so funny about this?[N]
Lady Magdalena, on your guard[Beat][A]
[MidRight]
[Beat][CloseEyes]How fitting.[A][N]
I truly can never[N]
escape violence, can I?[A][N]
Nor justice, for my crimes[Beat][A]
[FarLeft]
[Beat]So you do admit guilt.[A][N]
I had no wish to[N]
accuse you, but[Beat][A]
[Left][3LB]
But we are.[A][N]
You've ruined countless[N]
lives, in your days[N]
as a soldier in T.O.R.C.H.[A][N]
Here's a taste of[N]
your own medicine.[A]
[MidRight][2LB]

Come, angels of death.[A][N]

[Beat]And what's it to you?[A]

Captain Lua and I[N]
have studied all we can,[N]
gathered all our evidence[Beat][A]

And we think you[N]
killed Father Gavriel,[N]
and all those others.[A][N]
You're under arrest.[A]

[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]Look, who set you up for this?[A]
[Left][1LB]
Hm?[A]
[MidRight][2LB]
Just give me a name.[N]
Some political rival, perhaps?[A][N]
One of those Imperial mages whose[N]
theories I keep disproving?[A]
[FarLeft][3LB]
[Beat]No[Beat] none of those.[A][N]
Nothing but our own understanding[N]
of the murders that have[N]
stained Port Receloso[Beat][A]
[MidRight][2LB]
Or maybe it is you, Lady Magdalena,[N]
casting out a rival sorcerer in town.[A]
[Left]
I don't know what[N]
grudges you two had.[A][N]
But what I do know is that[N]
you're a killer loose in town.[A][N]
Now, Cruz, put down your[N]
tome and come quietly.[A]
[MidRight]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Very well. I'll[N]
submit to your judgement.[A][N]
This mishap in your logic[N]

Captain Lua, I[Beat][A][N]
I must thank you, truly, for your[N]

For bringing the killer to justice,[N]

Now, Lady Magdalena, how about[N]
you repay your end of the deal?[A]
[MidLeft][MoveLeft]
[FarLeft][LoadDesiderio]
[FarLeft][3LB]
The supplies?[A][N]
I've drawn up a whole[N]
list of what we need.[A][N]
For starters, that forest[N]
outside of town has lots[N]
of good lumber for repairs[Beat][A]
[Left][2LB]
Quick on the draw[N]
as ever, Desiderio.[A]
[FarLeft]
Not too many useful things to[N]
do while you're out investigating.[A][N]
It was this or getting drunk.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]Though I will say, that[N]
homebrewed mead was tempting.[ToggleSmile][A]
[MidRight]
This list[Beat][A][N]
We will gather all we can[N]
to aid you, Captain Lua.[A]
[Left]
Thank you.[A][N]
Desiderio, we'll bring[N]
in the supplies overnight.[A][N]
Get the crew to rest.[N]
Tomorrow[Beat] [ToggleSmile]we sail.[A][X]



## B2a_TalkToWindow
The window of the priest's[N]
chamber is utterly torn asunder.[A][N]
The positioning of shards indicates[N]
it was broken from the inside,[A][N]
and sharp edges all around have[N]
caught tangled, sooty threads.[A][X]

## B2a_TalkToDesk
On the writing desk[N]
lies an open envelope.[A][N]
It seems to be a love letter,[N]
although neither the writer nor[N]
the recipient's name is included,[A][N]
discussing plans to meet at[N]
some unspecified future date.[A][N]
The envelope is clearly cut open,[N]
as though by a letter opener,[N]
though none are present at the desk.[A][X]

## B2a_TalkToHedge
A steel letter opener is[N]
tossed aside, carelessly[N]
buried in this hedge.[AN]
It's barely hidden at all-[N]
almost conspicuously visible.[AN]
The blade is clean and well-made,[N]
despite this incongruous location.[A][X]

## B2a_TalkToGavriel
Here lies the corpse of Father Gavriel.[A][N]
A middle-aged man in[N]
fine white priestly robes,[A][N]
his face is frozen open[N]
in a gasp of surprise.[A][N]
The death was recent,[N]
as decay has only just begun.[A][N]
Around his chest and heart[N]
are scattered five thin,[N]
rounded puncture wounds,[A][N]
forming the center of a[N]
wide stain of dried blood.[A][X]

## B2a_TalkToPilar
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadPilar]
[MR]
Getting into the sway of[N]
things, Captain? You learn fast.[A]
[ML]
I'm doing what I can.[A]
[MR]
Well, if you'd like to know,[AN]
you're not the only one[N]
doing a bit of detective work.[AN]
I've been looking into[N]
that Avocado character myself.[A]
[ML][1LB]
And have you found anything?[A]
[MR][3LB]
No[Beat] not much.[N]
And that's the issue.[A][N]
He's[Beat] secretive.[A][N]
Been in town for years, but he[N]
barely speaks a word about his past.[A][N]
And he starts sharpening his[N]
lance whenever he sees me out[N]
of the corner of his eye.[A]
[ML][2LB]
Mm. That's certainly[N]
suspicious, I'll admit[Beat][A][N]
But would an old man be able[N]
to sneak into the church?[A]
[MR]
A T.O.R.C.H. soldier?[A] Knowing[N]
how to raid a place?[A][N]
Not as surprising as you think.[A]
[ML]
That's certainly true. We know[N]
that from experience, now[Beat][A]
[MR]
Plus, all the victims[N]
had Incendivis connections.[A][N]
Even that Gavriel man - he[N]
was an Imperial Healer, once.[A][N]
And Avocado's let enough slip to make[N]
it clear he's no friend of theirs.[A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat][A]
[MR][3LB]
That's a dangerous man.[A][N]
Watch your back around him,[N]
if you don't want to[N]
join the list of victims.[A]
[ML][2LB]
I will. Try to stay[N]
safe yourself, too.[A]
[MR]
[ToggleSmile]Oh, I have experience, Captain.[N]
I know what I'm doing.[ToggleSmile][A]
[ML]
[ToggleSmile]Do you now, Pilar?[A][N]
You never cease to be[N]
a mystery of your own.[A][X]

## B2a_TalkToDesiderio
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]
Captain! Got something[N]
important to tell you, here.[A]
[MR]
What is it?[A][N]
I thought you were staying[N]
here to guard the armada.[A]
[ML]
So during the descent,[N]
I overheard Pilar talking.[A][N]
She said she wasn't sure why[N]
pirates didn't own this town,[A][N]
and blamed it on just[N]
not being worth the effort.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]But that can't be right, can it?[A][N]
After all, they have enough[N]
resources to offer us supplies.[A]
[ML]
Well, I've found an answer.[N]
This place is Rebel turf.[A][N]
A pack of those thugs have turned[N]
the port into their playground.[A]
[MR]
A hideout for the Rebel[Beat][N]
That would explain things.[A]
[ML]
And, personally? I think[N]
they killed the priest.[A]
[MR][1LB]
Why?[A]
[ML][3LB]
Hard to say.[N]
I'm no detective.[A][N]
Just seems in their wheelhouse,[N]
to assassinate anyone[N]
with a shred of backbone.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
Oh, and one more thing.[A][N]
That Cruz? The magician boy?[N]
He's their biggest fan.[A][N]
Not all the local rebels[N]
actually live in town,[A][N]
but those that do love[N]
coming to his tower.[A]
[MR]
So you think Cruz and the[N]
rebels might be to blame[Beat][A][N]
Thank you for your help, Desiderio.[A]
[ML][1LB]
[ToggleSmile]Glad to hear.[A][X]

## B2a_TalkToRazvan

[MR][LoadRazvan]
[MR][1LB]
[CloseEyes][Beat]no, she can't be[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
Razvan, you're mumbling to[N]
yourself. Are you all right?[A]
[MR]
[OpenEyes]Captain Lua[Beat] it's about Husniye.[A][N]
One of the suspects[Beat] the[N]
one they call the thief.[A]
[ML][1LB]
And what about her?[A]
[MR][3LB]
I don't want her to be the murderer.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]She[Beat] doesn't feel like a[N]
bad person, to me, even[N]
though the townsfolk hate her.[A][N]
She reminds me of my family,[N]
just trying to get by[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
You're hesitating.[N]
There's a catch.[A]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]but I think she might be.[A][N]
That's just[Beat] just[N]
how all the facts line up.[A][N]
She needs money, and people[N]
say she had some sort of[N]
relationship with Father Gavriel.[A][N]
The past victims had a noble.[A][N]
And just by looking at her,[A][N]
she clearly knows how[N]
to sneak, how to kill[Beat][A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat][A]
[MR][2LB]
What if[Beat] what if she[N]
really is the murderer?[A][N]
If people like us really are?[A]
[ML]
[CloseEyes][Beat]Razvan[Beat][A][N]
[OpenEyes]Just stay here.[N]
Rest.[A][N]
I'll take care of the[N]
investigation from here.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadLua]
[ML]
[Beat]Another one of you,[N]
here to laugh at me.[A][N]
Go on, then.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat]Are you Husniye?[A]
[ML]
What does it matter to you?[A]
[MR][2LB]
My name is Captain Lua.[A][N]
I'm here to investigate the murder-[A]
[ML][1LB]
They all blame it on me![A]
[MR]
Hm? What are you talking about?[A]
[ML][2LB]
Everyone on the streets[Beat][A][N]
they have only ever looked[N]
at me with disdain.[A][N]
Ever since I arrived here,[N]
the last of my coin spent.[A][N]
And now, a foreign beggar woman[N]
on the streets of Receloso[Beat][A][N]
I am their scapegoat.[N]
As I always have been.[A]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]Luckily for you,[N]
I'm not from this port.[A][N]
I only landed here to[N]
restock on supplies.[A][N]
I just want to find the[N]
killer and fulfill my end[N]
of Lady Magdalena's bargain.[A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat][A]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]And on that note.[A][N]
What were you doing on[N]
the night of Gavriel's death?[A]
[ML]
[Beat]I did plan to go to[N]
the church, that night.[A][N]
To meet with Father Gavriel.[A]
[MR][1LB]
What? Why?[A]
[ML][3LB]
To[Beat] [CloseEyes]talk.[A][N]
To have a place to sleep,[N]
off the street with a[N]
roof over my head.[A][N]
He was the only person[N]
in this town who even[N]
pretended to care about me,[A][N]
and now[Beat] now they[N]
all say I killed him![A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
Please, Lua[Beat][CloseEyes] You, at[N]
least, have to believe me.[A][N]
I have nothing and no one[N]
to speak in my defense.[A][N]
But it is the truth.[A][N]
You have to believe me.[A][N]
I am many things,[N]
some dark and cruel,[A][N]
but I[Beat] [OpenEyes]I am no murderer![A]
[MR]
If you really weren't the[N]
one who killed Gavriel,[A][N]
then the evidence will support that.[A][N]
I[Beat] [CloseEyes]want to believe you, Husniye.[N]
But I need to be sure, first.[A]

[MR]
I don't believe I've[N]
seen your face before[Beat][A]
[ML]
My name is Captain Lua.[N]
Lady Magdalena brought me in to-[A]
[MR]
-investigate the murder, yes?[N]
The one where I'm suspected?[A]
[ML][1LB]
You're quick to realize.[A]
[MR][2LB]
Thank you. [ToggleSmile]I pride[N]
myself on my quick wit[ToggleSmile].[A]
[ML]
[Beat]In any case, what[N]
do you have to say?[A]
[MR]
I don't comprehend why people[N]
are blaming the killing on me.[A][N]
It's nonsense, is what it is.[A]
[ML][1LB]
How so?[A]
[MR][2LB]
The reports said Father Gavriel[N]
was found stabbed to death.[A][N]
And just look at me! I'm so frail[N]
I struggle just to carry books.[A][N]
Do I look like I could take[N]
a blade and stab someone?[A]
[ML]
I suppose not, although knives[N]
aren't particularly heavy[Beat][A]
[MR]
And there's no way I could've[N]
been at the crime scene, either.[A][N]
During the night, I was taking[N]
a walk in the port outskirts,[A][N]
on the other side of the[N]
city from the church.[A]
[ML]
[Beat]And as for your motive?[A][N]
Rumors say you've some disagreements[N]
over politics with the victim[Beat][A]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]The Incendivis Empire disgusts me.[N]
I will admit that.[A][N]
I cannot abide by what it has[N]
done to so many lands and lives.[A][N]
But that grudge is not[N]
enough to make me kill[N]
a good man like Gavriel.[A]
[ML][2LB]
Very well.[N]
Thank you for your time, Cruz.[A][N]
We'll get to the bottom[N]
of this soon enough.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat]We will indeed.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadLua]
[MR][1LB]
And you are?[A]
[ML]
I'll have your name first.[A]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]Captain Lua.[A][N]
I'm working on Lady Magdalena's[N]
behalf to investigate the murder.[A]
[ML][1LB]
The murder blamed on me?[A]
[MR][2LB]
I'm[Beat] not accusing you, yet.[N]
I'd just like to hear your story.[A]
[ML]
[Beat]Avocado Suarez, at your service.[A][N]
[Beat]But these days, I am nothing[N]
more than a tired old man.[A]
[MR]
That's not quite right.[A][N]
Magdalena said you were[N]
quite the soldier, in your day.[A]
[ML]
Aye.[N]
I was[Beat] [CloseEyes]a member of T.O.R.C.H., once.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
But I could no longer stomach the[N]
destruction they left in their wake.[A][N]
So I left. Now, I am here.[A]
[MR]
I hope you can understand why I[N]
can't exactly trust a T.O.R.C.H. member,[A][N]
even a former one.[A]
[ML]
And you would be right to feel that way.[A][N]
But I put that life behind me[N]
when I deserted, and killing with it.[A][N]
I'd[Beat] never assassinate someone[N]
in the dead of night.[A] [Beat]Not again.[A]
[MR][1LB]
Not again?[A]
[ML][2LB]
[OpenEyes]You heard nothing.[N]
Forget it.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
In any case, Father Gavriel[N]
was not mine to kill.[A][N]
He was[Beat] a good man, despite his[N]
background as an Imperial healer.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]I mourn for him.[A]
[MR]
Do you have anything else[N]
to say in your defense?[A]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat][OpenEyes]I could not have been at[N]
the church that fateful night.[A][N]
I had been[Beat] [CloseEyes]struggling to sleep.[N]
The nightmares were too great.[A][N]
So I went to Cruz's tower,[N]
where Miss Fogaca works,[N]
to read and clear my head.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]She can surely back up my story.[A]
[MR][1LB]
So that's all, then? Avocado?[A]
[ML][2LB]
Aye. It is the truth,[N]
tragic as it may seem.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]To be blunt, I[N]
still don't trust you.[A][N]
Not after what you've done.[A][N]
But if this alibi is correct, then[N]
I doubt you can be the murderer[Beat][A][X]

## B2a_TalkToFogaca
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[MidRight][LoadFogaca]
[MR][3LB]
Hm? Oh, you must be here[N]
to investigate the murder.[A][N]
I study from Cruz at his[N]
tower - I'm a historian in[N]
training, you see-[A][N]
and I've been keeping close[N]
tabs on the string of deaths[N]
over these past few weeks.[A]
[ML][2LB]
A string of deaths[Beat]?[A][N]
Lady Magdalena only told[N]
us about Gavriel.[A]
[MR][3LB]
Gavriel was the latest, yes,[N]
but there were several more[N]
gruesome killings before him.[A][N]
A visiting nobleman from[N]
the Incendivis capital,[N]
here to train youths as Healers,[A][N]
had his room in the inn[N]
burn down around him.[A][N]
And before him, that dear[N]
old widowed drunkard Ginovisa -[A][N]
lost her husband decades[N]
ago fighting Rebels, you see -[A][N]
was found stabbed to[N]
death in the woods![A]
[ML][2LB]
Those are[Beat] truly gruesome.[N]
I think we'll be going now.[A][N]
Thank you for your help[N]
solving the case, miss-[A]
[MR]
[ToggleSmile]Miss Fogaca.[N]
Glad I could help.[A][N]
Oh, and I've built a theory about[N]
who killed all those people, too.[A][N]
Would you like to hear it?[ToggleSmile][A]
[ML][1LB]
Uh-[A]
[MR][2LB]
Of the three suspects, I think[N]
they were killed by Avocado.[A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat]Why is that?[A]
[MR]
So do you know Avocado's past?[A]
[ML][2LB]
He's a former Imperial[N]
soldier, who deserted-[A]
[MR][3LB]
-because of the awful[N]
things they made him do![A][N]
Executions, tortures,[N]
destruction, you name it.[A][N]
He's got all this pent-up[N]
bloodlust and rage inside him[Beat][A][N]
It[Beat] [CloseEyes]scares me, whenever[N]
I see him walking near[N]
the tower late at night.[A][N]
And with the old weapons[N]
and armor he keeps around,[N]
who knows what he's capable of?[OpenEyes][A]
[ML][2LB]
For someone as, er, excited as[N]
you to be scared of Avocado[Beat][A][N]
I'll be cautious around him[N]
as I continue my investigations.[A][N]
Thank you, Miss Fogaca.[A]
[MR][3LB]
[ToggleSmile]Again, I'm glad I could help.[A][N]
Whoever they may be, good[N]
luck bringing this evil,[N]
awful murderer to justice![A][X]

## B2a_TalkToDario

[MidRight][LoadDario]
[MR]
Greetings, Captain![A][N]
My name's Dario, and[N]
I'm the town guard.[A][N]
I'm defending the gates,[A][N]
so none of the suspects[N]
make a run for it.[A]
[ML]
Thank you. You're making this[N]
investigation a whole lot easier.[A]
[MR][1LB]
[ToggleSmile]You're welcome![ToggleSmile][A]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]By the by.[A][N]
As a guard, you keep[N]
watch over the port, yes?[A][N]
Did you see any suspicious activity[N]
the night of Gavriel's death?[A]
[MR][3LB]
Hm. Can't say too much.[A][N]
I was on watch down by the forest,[N]
not anywhere near the church.[A][N]
There were some farmers working[N]
late, and a few of the[N]
local Rebels running about,[A][N]
but not much else.[A]
[ML][2LB]
The local Rebels? I haven't[N]
heard anything about those.[A]
[MR][3LB]
Yeah.[A][N]
Some criminals and pirates[N]
hang out in the forest,[A][N]
calling themselves part[N]
of the Rebel cause,[A][N]
and I heard they even[N]
have a hideout there[Beat][A][N]
they're always running around,[N]
doing something or other.[A][N]
Father Gavriel did give a sermon[N]
imploring them to come to justice,[N]
a few nights before[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
Hm. That's an important clue.[N]
Thank you for your service, Dario.[A][N]
Keep your watch here, for now.[A][X]

## B2a_TalkToQuim
[ML][LoadLua]
[MR][LoadQuim]
[ML]
So you were one of the acolytes[N]
at Father Gavriel's church?[A]
[MR]
Aye, I was.[AN]
He was as kind as a father[N]
by birth to all of us, too,[A][N]
and he helped even more people[N]
back as an Imperial Healer.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]Seeing him dead like that[Beat][N]
[OpenEyes]it makes my blood boil.[A]
[ML]
You were the first to find his[N]
body, yes? What happened then?[A]
[MR][3LB]
After evening sermons, as we[N]
at the church went to bed,[A][N]
he sent me off to find this[N]
old piece of jewelry[Beat][A][N]
something fancy, like an[N]
Imperial noblewoman would wear.[A][N]
Not quite sure why.[A][N]
Just as I was on the way out,[N]
I saw some shadowy, cloaked[N]
figure entering the church.[A][N]
I went inside and found[N]
Father Gavriel lying dead,[A][N]
bloody stab wounds through[N]
his neck and chest.[A]
[ML][2LB]
That's[Beat] [CloseEyes]awful.[N]
I'm sorry.[A][OpenEyes]
[MR][3LB]
I started chasing the killer,[A][N]
and found that they'd smashed[N]
Gavriel's bedroom window and[N]
leaped out into the garden.[A][N]
Surprised a petite woman managed[N]
to muster the strength to break it.[A]
[ML][2LB]
A[Beat] petite woman?[N]
So you think Husniye killed him?[A]
[MR]
Oh, I KNOW Husniye killed him.[A][N]
That's how all the facts fit,[N]
with the sneaking and stabbing.[A][N]
And the motive, too.[A]
[ML][1LB]
Hm?[A]
[MR][3LB]
A foreigner, desperate for money,[N]
not quite right in the head[Beat][A][N]
only natural she'd try[N]
to rob a rich man.[A][N]
Maybe the theft went wrong,[N]
or maybe she wanted to[N]
shank him from the start.[A][N]
Who knows?[A][N]
What matters is that you[N]
bring that murderess to justice.[A]
[ML]
Thank you for your help, Acolyte.[N]
I'll take things from here.[A][X]

[MR][3LB]
Hm? This old locket on my desk?[A][N]
It used to be that old[N]
man Avocado's, you see.[A][N]
Some treasure dear to him[Beat][A][N]
But he pawned it off[N]
to me for beer money.[A][N]
It had too many painful[N]
memories attached, he said.[A][N]
Oh, and Father Gavriel was[N]
asking after it, too,[N]
just a few days ago[Beat][A][N]
But I guess that's[N]
off the table now.[A][N]
At this point, I've half a mind[N]

And you are?[A]
[ML][2LB]
You can call me Thais, dearie.[A][N]
I tend the bar around here[Beat][N]
or, at least, I try to.[A]
[MR]
I could certainly use a drink,[A][N]
once this whole murder[N]
investigation is put to rest.[A]
[ML]
We all could, in[N]
dark days like these[Beat][A][N]
Ah, and speaking of the murder.[A][N]
You're here to ask me[N]
some questions, I take it?[A]
[MR]
I am.[A][N]
Do you have much of note to[N]
say, all the way over here?[A]
[ML]
Why yes, I do.[A][N]
You see, all three of the suspects[N]
frequented this very bar.[A]
[MR]
So would you know much about[N]
what they got up to here?[A]
[ML][3LB]
Well, none were at the bar[N]
on the night of the murder[Beat][A][N]
But I can tell you[N]
what they usually did.[A][N]
Husniye spent her time cleaning[N]
mugs for coin, or performing[N]
for the other patrons.[A][N]
Once, I tried giving her[N]
a bed to sleep in,[A][N]
but she left in the morning[N]
with my purse in hand.[A][N]
Not a mistake I'll[N]
make again, I say![A]
[MR][1LB]
And what of Avocado and Cruz?[A]
[ML][3LB]
Oh, those two dearies?[A][N]
Avocado just came in to[N]
drink, like everyone else[Beat][A][N]
just lying at the bar and[N]
drowning his sorrows.[A][N]
And he has a lot of those,[N]
from all his years![A][N]
Cruz, though? He[N]
came to argue politics.[A][N]
He'd meet with some of[N]
those Rebel folk who[N]
also like to come here.[A][N]
And whenever Incendivis came up,[N]
he got[Beat] heated, let's say.[A][N]
Though maybe that was[N]
just my homebrew mead talking.[A][N]
It's very good, want a mug?[A]
[MR][2LB]
Ask again this evening.[A][N]
[Beat]But when you're saying[N]
Cruz lost his temper[Beat][A][N]
did he get angry enough[N]
to want to kill someone?[A]
[ML]
Well, late at night, it[N]
can get hard to tell[Beat][A][N]
but maybe.[A][N]
At least, in those[N]
crazy tales of his,[A][N]
he sounds like someone[N]
who might be a killer.[A][N]
Of course, I'm not accusing him[N]
of the murder or anything-[A][N]
after all, he's one of[N]
my most reliable patrons![A][N]
Just that, you know, I[N]
have a wild theory or two[Beat][A][N]
Pay it no mind, dearie.[A]
[MR]
I'll pay what mind I need to.[N]
Thank you for your help, Thais.[A]
[ML]
You're very welcome.[A][N]
Oh, and maybe let the rest[N]
of your crew know I'm here,[A][N]
in case any of them[N]
need a drink too[Beat][A][X]
