Finally,[.4] I can see the gates.[A]

[FR][2LB]
That's the annoying thing about inland towns,[.4][N]
can't just park right in the middle.[A]

[FL][3LB]
Yes well,[.4] either way we're here now.[.4][N]
Best look presentable and try and act[N]
like we aren't pirates on the run.[A]

[R][2LB]
Looks a bit quiet up ahead,[.4] not a guard[N]
in sight.[.4] Bit unusual if you ask me.[A]

[FL][2LB]
Hmm.[.4] Now that you mention it[Beat][.4] Best[N]
to keep our guard up then.[.5] Never know[N]
what goes on out this far from the empire.[A][X]

[FR][LoadPirate][2LB]
What do we have here?[.4] Buncha[N]
wandering misfits in our town?[A]

[L][2LB]
Your town?[.4] You don't exactly look[N]
like ordinary townsfolk to me.[A]

[R][2LB]
Guess you ain't heard.[.4] This town's[N]
had a change of management.[AN]
And the new management don't take[N]
kindly to strangers just wandering in.[A]

[L][2LB]
Looks like a gang of ruffians has moved[N]
in Lua.[.4] It doesn't seem worth the fuss.[A]

[FL]
You're right,[.4] I don't like it but[N]
we haven't got time to be playing hero.[AN]
Well,[.4] it was lovely chatting with you[N]
both but I think we'll be on our way then.[A]

[FR][3LB]
I don't think you quite understand,[.4] we're[N]
not asking you guys to leave,[.4] in fact[N]
we're not letting you leave at all.[A]

[FL][2LB]
Tch.[.5] Well,[.4] it doesn't seem[N]
like we have much of a choice.[AN]
Well if you want to be that way we'll[N]
just have to show you your own mistake.[AN]
Crew![.4] To arms,[.4] let's rout these[N]
flightless desert rats.[A][X]


## HubB_4BeginningScene4
[ML][LoadPilar]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML][2LB]
Bad news Lua,[.4] just spotted[N]
an imperial ship on the horizon.[AN]
They're probably on their way here[N]
to deal with the bandits themselves.[A]

[MR][3LB]
Could this day go any more wrong?[.4][N]
We'll just have to finish and get[N]
out of here as fast as we can.[A]

[ML][2LB]
I'd give us [Red]10 minutes[Red] for[N]
us to clean this bandit hole.[AN]
If we want any chance of leaving[N]
before they get here that is.[A][X]




## HubB_4EndingScene1
[ML][LoadLua][2LB]
I think that's the lot of them.[.4][N]
I thought that would never end.[A]

[MR][LoadGreagorLibrarianB][2LB]
Traveller![.4] I cannot thank you enough[N]
for ridding us of these bandits.[AN]
I am the mayor of our little oasis.[.4][N]
Who are you?[.4] Incendivis mercenaries?[A]

[ML][2LB]
Hah-[.4] Nothing like that,[.4][N]
[Beat] to be honest,[.4] we're pirates.[AN]
We were here to make some trade but,[.4][N]
well,[.4] we weren't expecting brigands.[A]

[MR][3LB]
Yes,[.4] well,[.4] unfortunately being one of the[N]
few prosperous towns this far out makes[N]
us a ripe target for criminal sorts.[AN]
They moved in a week and a half ago and[N]
slaughtered our guard.[.4] No Incendivis[N]
to protect us this far out I'm afraid.[AN]
They were extorting us for everything we[N]
had,[.4] so it's a good thing you came along[N]
miss.[.4] Pirates or no,[.4] you have our gratitude.[A]

[ML][3LB]
I'm glad of that at least.[.4] Being a pirate[N]
may not be the most moral,[.4] but extorting[N]
innocent villagers is just low beyond low.[A]

[MR][2LB]
Oh but I'm forgetting myself,[.4] you must be[N]
exahausted,[.4] we can tend your crew's wounds.[AN]
We could prepare a meal to too,[.4] it's not[N]
much given the circumstances but[Beat][A]

[ML][3LB]
We're flattered really but,[.5] well,[.4][N]
there's an Incendivis ship on the horizon[N]
and unfortunately we're on the run.[AN]
They must be here to deal with[N]
your former bandit problem.[AN]
But we can't stay,[.4] in fact we[N]
really should be going before[N]
they can catch up to us.[A]

[MR][2LB]
Well,[.4] I know not the circumstances[N]
of your wanted status but I care not.[AN]
You are clearly a crew of moral fiber[Beat][.5][AN]
I want you to have this,[.4] I trust[N]
it will be of use in your journeys.[A]

Sir-[.4] we can't-[.4][A]

[MR][2LB]
But you can,[.4] now go before they get[N]
here.[.4] Lest you get into another scuffle.[A][X]

[MR][LoadRedSoldier]
[ML][2LB]
Sir it appears that the bandits[N]
have already been wiped out.[AN]
And recently too,[.4] these[N]
bodies are very fresh.[A]

[MR][2LB]
Is that so?[.4] Perhaps it was[N]
some kind of bandit turf war?[AN]
But then there's not a lot of[N]
large gangs around these parts.[AN]
And besides,[.4] they would still be[N]
here if that was the case[Beat][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[Event]

[ML][MoveLeft]
[FL][LoadRedSoldier][3LB]
Sir![.4] We've spoken to some of the[N]
townsfolk,[.4] they seemed rather tight[N]
lipped but some gave some vague leads.[AN]
It appears a faction came here,[.4][N]
a fight broke out and they immediately left.[.4][N]
Perhaps it was mercenaries or pirates.[A]

[MR][1LB]
Pirates[Beat][.6] I wonder[Beat][A][CloseSpeechSlow]
[MR][3LB]
Private,[.4] I want you to get a message[N]
sent to Elodia.[.5] I think we might[N]
have a tip on her target[Beat][A][X]

[MR][LoadLexa]
[ML][3LB]
This does not look like it's[N]
going well at all sis.[AN]
I mean our guys are getting mowed[N]
down and there's that imperial[N]
boat coming in on the horizon[Beat][A]

[MR][3LB]
Maybe we should just jump ship[N]
again? I don't fancy dying[N]
in some desert nowhere village.[A]

[ML][3LB]
Agreed.[.4] Let's just talk to one[N]
that looks important and flip sides[N]
as soon as we get a chance.[A][X]

[MR][1LB]
And if I am?[A]

[L][2LB]
Look,[.4] we can see this gig is up,[.4][N]
so we want to offer to switch sides.[AN]
I don't want to end up dead in this[N]
town with the rest of these chumps.[A]

[MR][2LB]
Quick to switch sides aren't you?[.4][N]
What's to stop you backstabbing me too?[A]

[FL][2LB]
If you run a tight ship we wont.[.4] Besides[.4][N]
we could just front stab you now.[A]
[Event]
[MR][2LB]
[CloseEyes][Beat][.4][AN][OpenEyes]
I guess you make a good point,[.4] fair enough.[.4][N]
But one wrong move and you're out,[.4] got it?[A]

You a commander or something here?[A]

[MR][1LB]
And if I am?[A]

[L][2LB]
Look,[.4] we can see this gig is up,[.4][N]
so we want to offer to switch sides.[AN]
I don't want to end up dead in this[N]
town with the rest of these chumps.[A]

[MR][3LB]
I know all about your type.[.4] Leeches[N]
who turn tail as soon as the going[N]
gets tough,[.4] sound about right?[AN]
Why should I trust that you won't do[N]
the same to us?[.4] Heavens knows[N]
I've met enough backstabbers.[A]

[FL][3LB][ToggleSmile]
You make a fair point,[.4] I ain't gonna give[N]
you our whole sob story,[.4] but I think you could[N]
probably use our blades right now eh?[AN]
If you run a tight ship you won't have[N]
to worry about any kind of traitoring.[A]

[MR][1LB]
And if I am brigand?[A]

[FL][2LB]
We got a proposition for you then.[AN]
Me and my sister we're not dumb,[.4][N]
we can see that this gig is up.[AN]
So we're wanna fight for you instead,[.4] join[N]
your crew and leave these chumps behind.[AN][ToggleSmile]
What do you say old man?[A]

[MR][3LB][ToggleSmile]
Not very loyal are you?[.4] How[N]
do I know you won't just backstab[N]
us when it becomes convenient?[A]

[L][2LB][ToggleSmile]
Well,[.4] alternatively I could stab[N]
you in the front right now.[A]

[MR][3LB][ToggleSmile]
Ergh-[.6] that doesn't seem necessary[Beat][.6][N][Event]
Fine,[.4] you've made your point but you'll[N]
regret it if you think of crossing us too.[A]

Glad you could see things our[N]
