closer behind us.[A][N]
Not quite in range of[N]

[MR]
Then we reached the[N]

We'll need to find some[N]
clearing to land in.[A]

There. By the chasm.[A]
[MR][2LB]
What? I only see[N]
more trees there.[A]
[ML]
No, there was a-[A] Hm?[A][N]

Fire! Fire on the aft deck![A]

I'm TORCH's strongest soldier![A]

clear spot, it vanishes![A][N]
Captain, what do we do?!?[A]

[OpenEyes]What happened to my soldiers?[A]

Most of us survived, but[Beat][N]
the crash scattered us.[A][N]
We've spread out to search[N]
for the other survivors.[A]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I see our way out of this.[A][N]
The only way we won't[N]
be marooned here for[N]
the rest of our lives.[A]
[ML][1LB]
What is it, Captain?[A]
[MR][3LB]
[OpenEyes]Tell those patrolling soldiers[N]

We'll go after them[Beat] we'll[N]
take their ship for ourselves![A][N]

home to Commander Elodia,[A][N]
she'll know[Beat] [ToggleSmile]they'll all[N]

Small mercies, indeed.[AN]
Where are the others? I[N]
don't see Razvan anywhere[Beat][A]
[ML][3LB]
Bad news, Captain.[N]
See that debris, there?[AN]
The bits that really went[N]
to hell were the ones[N]
holding the armada together.[A]

This forest's a maze, even[N]
aside from the illusions[Beat][A][N]

Get off my island.[AN]
Now.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadNicodemus]
[OpenQuote]Your" island? I'm afraid[N]
this is Incendivis territory.[A][N]

You'll die either way, but[N]

[Beat]The captain of the Blackhearts[Beat][N]
That dastard![A][N]
Is there really nothing other[N]
pirates won't do when they're[N]
ruining people's lives?[A]
[FL][2LB]
It's nothing out of the ordinary.[A][N]
Of course Imperial dogs would[N]
sell out to common thieves.[A]
[FR]
Not just this one captain, Pilar[Beat][A][N]
I think the Blackhearts[N]
are helping all of TORCH.[A][N]
The log entry earlier said Elodia[N]
was working with the pirates, too.[A]
[FL]
Then they're all in on it.[A][N]
Typical. One band of[N]
brigands deserves another.[A]
[L][3LB]
[ToggleSmile]I can almost respect it.[A][N]
Alonso's a bastard, sure,[N]
but it takes a lot of courage[N]
to pull something like this off.[ToggleSmile][A]
[FL][2LB]
There's no [OpenQuote]courage" in[N]
selling out to Incendivis.[A][N]
Anyone with a coin purse[N]
can recruit a hired thug.[A]
[FR]
Courageous or not, we[N]
know he's on our trail[Beat][A][N]
and we know our two greatest enemies[N]
have joined forces to hunt us down.[A]
[R]
We can't linger in the[N]
Ghostwood any longer,[A][N]
not even to search for treasure.[A][N]
If they catch us here[Beat][A]
[FR][3LB]
You're right, Razvan.[N]
We need to get moving.[A][N]
Once we gather up[N]
whatever plunder we can,[A][N]
we need to set sail and[N]
set course for a new destination.[A][N]
Somewhere where we can flee[N]
from both Incendivis and the[N]
Blackhearts' prying eyes[Beat][A][X]
