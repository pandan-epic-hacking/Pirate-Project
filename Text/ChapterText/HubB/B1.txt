[MidLeft][LoadLua][MidRight][LoadRazvan]
[MidRight][2LB]
Ah,[.4] Captain![.4][N]
Do you have a moment?[A]

[MidLeft][1LB]
What's on your mind Razvan?[A]

[MidRight][3LB]
Well, since we're on the outskirts[N]
I've been thinking. This place isn't too[N]
far out from my hometown.[AN]
I travelled around a bit in my[N]
time here and there's a village nearby[N]
where I remember rumors of treasure.[A]

[MidLeft][1LB]
Is that so?[A]

[MidRight][2LB]
Indeed.[.5] It was[Beat][.4] a while ago[N]
but perhaps it's worth investigating?[A]

[MidLeft][1LB]
Do you know anything about this treasure?[A]

[MidRight][3LB]
Truth be told I can't remember much.[.5][N]
But I remember hearing it was[N]
riches and weapons in a desert ruin.[AN]
But it seems like it could be real,[.5][N]
I mean the desert hides many treasures.[A]

[MidLeft][1LB]
I suppose a lead is a lead.[A]
[X]




## HubB_1StartingSceneDeny
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
No.[A][X]




## HubB_1StartingScene2
[MidLeft][LoadLua][MidRight][LoadRazvan]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Alright,[.4] seems like a reasonable[N]
idea.[.5] We could use the funds.[AN]
Do you still remember the way?[A]

[MidRight][2LB]
Somewhat,[.4] though we'll need to[N]
find some clues about the treasure.[A]

[MidLeft][2LB]
Well it's not like we're above[N]
a little investigative work.[AN]
Go talk to Pilar and see about[N]
charting us a course there.[A]

[MidRight][1LB]
Right away captain![A]
[X]




##HubB_1BeginningScene1
[MidLeft][LoadLua][Right][LoadRazvan][FarRight][LoadPilar]
[MidLeft][2LB]
Typical,[.4] not a single person around[N]
here wants to tell us anything.[A]

[FarRight][2LB]
Everyone I spoke to alludes to it[N]
being dangerous,[.4] not worth the risk.[AN]
All seems to be hearsay though.[A]

[Right]
We have to be able to find someone[N]
surely![.5] Someone must know![A]

[MidLeft][2LB]
I'd say at this point it's unlikely[N]
to go anywhere Razvan,[.4] sorry.[AN]
Let's just enjoy a night at this[N]
tavern and cut our losses for today.[AN]
No use trekking in the desert blindly.[N]
We'll set off again in the morning.[A]

[FarFarRight][LoadDmitr][1LB]
I might be able to help with that.[A]

[Right][ClearFace][FarRight][ClearFace]
[FarFarRight][MoveMidRight]
[MidLeft][1LB]
Oh?[.5] And who might you be?[A]

[MidRight][2LB]
I'm Dmitr.[.5] I heard you asking[N]
around about those treasure rumors.[AN]
I have spent much time in the[N]
desert, I am willing to be your guide.[A]

[MidLeft][3LB]
Is that so?[.5] And what's in it for[N]
you?[.5] Why haven't you claimed[N]
the treasure for yourself?[AN]
Seems a bit suspect you[N]
have to admit?[A]

[MidRight][3LB]
I ask for payment for my services.[AN]
People speak of vengeful spirits[N]
inhabiting those ruins and none,[.4][N]
even I,[.4] dare set foot there.[AN]
But for the right price with your[N]
party in tow,[.4] I could be swayed.[AN]

[MidLeft][2LB]
[Beat][.5] I see,[.4] well I don't[N]
know about vengeful spirits.[AN]
But we certainly can't find our way[N]
around the desert on our own.[AN]
What's your fee for your guidance?[A]

[MidRight][2LB]
A cut of the treasure itself[N]
should suffice for me.[A]

[MidLeft][2LB]
Acceptable terms,[.4] very well[N]
we'll set out tomorrow.[A]
[X]


##HubB_1BeginningScene2
[FarLeft][LoadLua][Left][LoadRazvan][Right][LoadDmitr][FarRight][LoadPilar]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Never did I think I could get[N]
so tired of seeing sand.[A]

[Right][2LB]
It's not far now,[.4] we should[N]
be able to see it soon.[A]

[Left][2LB]
It's a good thing we left later[N]
on.[.5] It would be way too hot earlier.[A]

[FarRight][2LB]
We can't be out here too long[N]
though.[.4] It'll be freezing[N]
once it gets really dark.[A]

[Right][2LB]
I think I see it in the distance.[.5][N]
only a half hour more at most.[A]

[FarLeft][2LB]
Good.[.5] I don't think I want[N]
to keep walking much longer.[AN]
Let's get this over with and[Beat][.5][N]
Walk another hour back[Beat][A]
[X]


##HubB_1BeginningScene3
[MidLeft][LoadKiril][MidRight][LoadPirate]
[MidRight][3LB]
Boss.[.5] It looks like we got some[N]
travellers on the horizon.[.5] Large[N]
group too,[.4] not the usual adventurers.[A]

[MidLeft][3LB]
Tch.[.5] This late in the evening?[.5][N]
Get everyone ready then,[.4] this[N]
could potentially be a big haul[Beat][A]

[MidRight][1LB]
Of course,[.4] right away.[A]

[MidRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft][2LB]
A big wandering desert beast falling[N]
into the sand pit of the Antlion[Beat][AN]
This haul will keep us going[N]
for a long time[Beat][A][X]


##HubB_1BeginningScene4
[FarFarRight][LoadLua][MoveMidRight]
[MidRight][2LB]
The hell?[.5] This place is[N]
infested with bandits![A][CSS]

[MidRight][MoveMidLeft][CF]
[MidLeft][LoadLua][2LB]
Dmitr?![.5] Is this trap[N]
your bloody doing?[A]

[MidRight][LoadDmitr][2LB]
I swear I have nothing[N]
to do with this![AN]
Perhaps these are where the rumours[N]
of vengeful spirits come from.[AN]
But I promise I am a mere guide![.5][N]
I will help fight with you.[A]

[MidLeft][2LB]
Tch.[.5] Good enough for me.[.5][N]
Can't go anywhere without a damn fight.[AN]
Everyone ready up,[.4] lets clear[N]
out this blasted den.[A][X]






## HubB_1EndingScene1
[FarLeft][LoadLua][Left][LoadRazvan][Right][LoadDmitr][FarRight][LoadPilar]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Well,[.4] that's that.[.5] Yet another[N]
gang of upstarts put down[Beat][A]

[Left][2LB]
It's unfortunate their lives[N]
had to end in such a way.[AN]
I can't imagine hiding in a ruin[N]
waiting for travellers is much of a life.[A]

[FarRight][1LB]
No,[.4] but it's the life they chose.[A]

[FarLeft][2LB]
I suppose we should think about[N]
setting on back now[Beat][A]

[Right][2LB]
Indeed,[.4] it'll take us around[N]
an hour to get back to town.[AN]
We will want to set off immediately[N]
to avoid being stuck freezing at night.[A]

[Left][1LB]
I can hardly walk anymore[Beat][A]

[Right][2LB]
If you don't mind my asking,[.4][N]
what will you do when you return?[A]

[FarLeft][2LB]
I suppose we'll be sailing off[N]
and resuming our travels.[AN]
What's it to you?[A]

[Right][2LB]
I am a traveller myself,[.4] but in truth[N]
there is only so far one can go alone.[AN]
If you would permit it I would[N]
like to join you on your travels.[AN]
So long as I have room and board[N]
that is enough for me.[A]

[FarLeft][2LB]
Sure,[.4] you fought well and[N]
we could always use more bodies.[AN]
I should tell you though this is[N]
a pirate gang,[.4] we're outlaws.[AN]
You'll be expected to pull your weight.[A]

[Right][2LB]
I'd figured you were.[.5] This is fine[N]
with me.[.5] I'm merely concerned with travel.[A]

[FarLeft][1LB]
Alright then,[.4] let's get a move on.[A][X]


## HubB_1EndingScene1_B
[MidLeft][LoadLua][Right][LoadRazvan][FarRight][LoadPilar]

[MidLeft][2LB]
Well,[.4] that's that.[.5] Yet another[N]
gang of upstarts put down[Beat][A]

[Right][3LB]
What a shame about our guide though.[.5][N]
It brings sorrow to see a life[N]
cut so short.[.5] Especially helping us[Beat][A]

[MidLeft][2LB]
Yeah it's tough breaks.[.5] Maybe if[N]
I'd run a tighter ship[Beat][AN]
Still,[.5] he knew the risk of it.[.5][N]
Could've happened to any one of us.[AN]

[Right][2LB]
I suppose we should bury him no?[.5][N]
I can perform rites for him.[A]

[MidLeft][2LB]
Mhm.[.5] I reckon a wanderer like[N]
him wouldn't mind it out here.[AN]
Amongst the quiet under the stars.[A]

[Right][1LB]
I suppose that's true yes.[A]

[MidLeft][3LB]
Pilar,[.4] do you remember how we[N]
got out here?[.5] Reckon you could[N]
navigate us back to town?[A]

[FarRight][2LB]
I wouldn't be much of a[N]
navigator if I couldn't Lua.[AN]
I'll have us back before[N]
we end up freezing to death.[A]

[MidLeft][1LB]
Alright then,[.4] let's get a move on.[A][X]


## ThiefTextB_1
[MidLeft][LoadPirate][1LB]
Now's my chance to make my break.[A][CSS]
[MidLeft][2LB]
I'll pick what I can and be gone[N]
before anyone can notice me.[AN]
By the time Kiril find's out[N]
they'll have no chance of finding me.[A]
