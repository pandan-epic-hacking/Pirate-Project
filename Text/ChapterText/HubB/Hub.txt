## HubB_BeginningScene_1_1
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
Free and clear, at least for now[Beat][N]
Desiderio, care for another wager?[AN]
I brought my cards with me, and we've[N]
got a bit of time until our next stop.[A]
[ML]
I'm not fool enough to be fleeced twice.[AN]
Besides, we're not even close to safe,[N]
not with that woman hunting us down.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Relax. We took the only ship on hand,[N]
and there's just as many traps[N]
ready for them on the way out.[AN]
Pitfalls, spearwalls, fireballs[Beat][AN]
[ML][2LB]
[Beat]You're a nasty piece of work, boss.[N]
The hunted's really the hunter, huh?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Well, I wouldn't go that far.[N]
Elodia would've never gained notoriety[N]
if obstacles like that would work.[AN]
But it'll buy us time, time enough[N]
to pay Port Greagor one last visit.[AN]
I've got a vessel there to reclaim.[A]
[ML]
That bloated boat? Fair enough.[N]
Not like Orlando'll take it off[N]
our hands, since he's one of us.[AN]
[MR]
And we'll need it if our crew gets[N]
any larger. Speaking of, can you[N]
send a signal to that old coot?[AN]
He can keep an eye out for T.O.R.C.H.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Sure, but[Beat] you really trust him?[AN]
You two might go way back, but I've[N]
seen cleaner grime on a tavern floor.[AN]
[MR]
Grime comes with the territory;[N]
no successful merchant is fully moral.[AN]
That said, the man's helped me through[N]
hard times, long ago and even now.[AN]
If there's anyone I trust, it's him.[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Well, if he's good enough for you,[N]
then he's good enough for me.[AN]
And if he's not a very good watchman,[N]
at least Pilar'll have us covered.[AN]
[MR]
Mm. Reliable, as always[Beat][N]
Ah, there's the port now.[AN]
Let's make a quick landing![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_2
[ML][LoadIda]
[R][LoadLua]
[FR][LoadDesiderio]
[ML]
Well, looks like you finally showed up.[N]
Kept me waiting long enough, Lua.[AN]
[R]
Ida? What are you doing here,[N]
by my boat? Care to explain?[AN]
[FR][3LB]
Probably fixin' to take it for herself.[AN]
She wanted us outta here before T.O.R.C.H.[N]
came knocking, and now, they busted down[N]
our door. Who else gains from all of that?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]If you're trying to accuse me[N]
of calling Incendivis's hunting dogs,[N]
then you're dumber than I thought.[AN]
[FR][2LB]
You want a brawl that bad?[N]
All you had to do was ask![AN]
[R][3LB]
Desiderio, cool it![AN]
There's no proof that someone who's[N]
helped us all this time would turn,[N]
right? Take a step back and think.[AN]
We've made plenty of enemies who'd[N]
relish a chance to take us down.[A]
[FR][2LB]
[Beat]Pah. Fine, I'll shut it.[AN]
We've got no time to waste, anyway.[N]
Let's just get this thing flying.[AN]
[ML]
If that's what you want, you should[N]
be thanking me. It's already running.[AN]
[R]
Really? My thanks, but[Beat][N]
How did you know we were coming?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
I didn't, but some suspicious characters[N]
kept roving around the port. Pirates,[N]
I'd bet, but no flags to prove it.[AN]
One of my men told me as much,[N]
and that it kept getting worse,[N]
so I came down and chased them off.[AN]
Made me figure something was coming[N]
for your crew, so I did you a favor,[N]
figuring you wouldn't leave the ship.[AN]
Call it a reward for being a good[N]
customer. And as I say that[Beat][N]
Where's Rahel? She was with you.[A]
[R][2LB]
She's safe, just below board.[N]
Rahel! Ida's here![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_3
[ML][LoadIda]
[MR][LoadRahel]
[ML]
So[Beat] that's the situation, is it?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
I'm[Beat] I'm sorry, Master Ida.[AN]
The moment my horse came running to me,[N]
and their commanders saw me there[Beat][AN]
Between reasoning with T.O.R.C.H.[N]
and fighting my way out of there,[N]
I took my chances with the second one.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Here's a better option: stay out of it.[AN]
Not like the captain was relying on you,[N]
girl. You're not much of a fighter.[AN]
[MR]
'Course, but I[Beat] I couldn't run.[AN]
They'd seen me already, so hiding[N]
wouldn't have done any good.[N]
[Beat]What should I do, Master Ida?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You'll have a bounty drawn up soon,[N]
I'm sure, so you can't stay here.[AN]
Ha! A girl like you, with doubloons[N]
on her head[Beat] All for surviving,[N]
in a bad position that I put you in.[AN]
It shouldn't have come to that.[AN]
[MR][CloseEyes][1LB]
[Beat] [Beat][A]
[ML][3LB]
Well, here's your reward, at least.[AN]
Those doubloons should last you[N]
a while, if you're frugal.[N]
[Beat]As for what you should do?[AN]
You can make your own decisions,[N]
but if you've got no other plans,[N]
then why not join Lua's crew?[AN]
[MR][OpenEyes][2LB]
But[Beat] but that doesn't make sense![AN]
All this time, I've been training[N]
to become like you, Master Ida![AN]
And now, you're saying I should[N]
go follow a damned pirate?[AN]
After everything I've learned?[N]
With all I have left to do here?![AN]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]Listen to me, because I'll only[N]
say it once. You'll never be me.[AN]
As long as you're chasing my shadow,[N]
following me like a baby chick,[N]
you'll never even get close.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
But I[Beat] I still have so much to repay[N]
you for. I can't just leave, can I?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Whatever you think you owe me,[N]
save it. I took you in because[N]
you had nowhere else to go,[AN]
not because I expected a return.[AN]
[Beat]There's a wide world in these skies,[N]
one you haven't seen a bit of.[AN]
Find your own dream out there,[N]
instead of chasing after mine.[AN]
[MR]
I[Beat] Fine![A] If you don't want me here,[N]
then I'm gone. There's nothing for me[N]
in this shoddy port, anyway![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_4
[ML][LoadIda][3LB]
Maybe I was too hard on her.[N]
She needed to hear it, but[Beat][N]
It's tough seeing her tear up.[AN][MR][LoadLua][ML]
[Beat]Lua, what do you want?[N]
You should be ready to go.[A]
[MR][LoadLua]
I just wanted to say thanks,[N]
for everything you've done these[N]
past few months to help my crew.[AN]
I'm not sure that I can ever pay[N]
it back to you, but I'll try.[N]
If there's anything I can do, then-[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Yeah. There is one thing you can do,[N]
that only you can do for me, Lua.[AN]
Rahel[Beat] I got her into this mess,[N]
and I need you to keep her safe[N]
til it all blows over, alright?[AN]
If you do that, then we're square.[N]
I'm[Beat] I'm counting on you.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]Of course, Ida.[N]
I won't let you down.[AN]
You'll see her again,[N]
on my word as her captain![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_5
[ML][LoadRahel]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]
[Beat]What do you want?[AN]
[MR]
Just checking in on you.[AN]
You're part of my crew now,[N]
so it's kind of my job.[AN]
[ML]
Whatever.[N]
Are we leaving or not?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]Look, Rahel. I know you feel[N]
like you've lost a lot today,[N]
and you lashed out back there.[AN]
But don't let those be the last[N]
words you say to Ida, hear me?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
What? That's none of your business.[N]
I can say whatever I want.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]Yes, but you'd better be willing[N]
to live with it, no matter what.[AN]
If you never see her again,[N]
is that what you want her to remember?[AN]
As a kid, I bounced around orphanages,[N]
never staying at one for very long,[N]
so I never cared about someone like that.[AN]
But if I did, I wouldn't want this to[N]
be the last memory I had of them.[AN]
[Beat]Well, we're taking off right now,[N]
so whatever you decide, make it quick.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[ML]
[Beat] [Beat][N]
Damn it, I hope she doesn't hear me.[AN][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_1_6
[FR][LoadRahel]
Master Ida![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadIda]
Rahel? I thought you were setting sail.[N]
Are you sure you have time for this?[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FR][LoadRahel]
O-Of course I do![N]
I[Beat] I[Beat][AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FL][LoadIda][3LB]
[Beat]Keep your feet steady, alright?[N]
You've got to watch out for yourself,[N]
now. I won't be there to do it for you.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FR][LoadRahel]
I know that! I[Beat] I wanted to thank you.[N]
I'd be dead in a ditch without you[N]
taking me under your wing, Master Ida.[AN]
If you won't let me repay you,[N]
then all I can do is make you proud.[AN]
[Beat]That's all I wanted to say.[N]
Goodbye, Master Ida[Beat][N]
I'll never forget you![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_2_1
[L][LoadPilar]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]
Ah, Pilar.[N]
How do the skies look?[AN]
[L]
Free of pursuers.[AN]
[MR]
Excellent. Anything else to report?[N]
Good news, bad news, any news.[AN]
The peace is putting me on edge.[A]
[L]
Well[Beat] There is one thing.[N]
Come in, stowaway. You're wanted.[AN]
[FL][LoadPonte]
Oh boy, I am?[N]
I'm not used to this![AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Stowaway?[N]
Wait, from which boat?[AN]
[L]
The merchant ship. I found him[N]
hiding, poorly, behind a barrel.[AN]
[MR]
Well, out with it before[N]
I throw you overboard.[AN]
What's your business on my ship?[AN]
[FL]
Y-Yes, ma'am! The name's Ponte,[N]
and I wanna join your crew![AN]
I'm a real good carpenter,[N]
even better than Rahel![AN]
[MR]
I don't necessarily doubt you, but[Beat][N]
Are you carrying a massive ladder?[AN]
First, how, and more importantly, why?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Hm? Well, I've always been built[N]
like a sky ox! And I figure,[N]
it's real nice to have a path.[AN]
I can make this and put it down[N]
anywhere, long as I'm paid for it![AN]
[MR]
I[Beat] suppose I can see use in that,[N]
but what about your character?[AN]
Why do you want to become a pirate?[AN]
[FL]
Er, well[Beat] To tell ya the truth,[N]
I've got a rough background.[AN]
Piratin' ain't much to me,[N]
compared to where I've been.[AN]
But Master Ida saw somethin'[N]
in me and took me under her wing![AN]
I thought I'd be the next big shipwright[N]
'round port, but she told me that[N]
y'all were looking for more help.[AN]
Also, that you had a lotta gold[Beat][N]
So here I am! What's our next stop?[AN]
[MR][ToggleMouthMove]
(Damn it, Ida. I only signed up[N]
to do one favor, not two!)[AN][ToggleMouthMove]
Hm[Beat] You seem like an unimpressive[N]
fighter, but your[Beat] unique set[N]
of skills may prove useful to us.[AN]
I'll pay you resource costs for any[N]
services done, but the bulk of your[N]
payment will have to wait, Ponte.[AN]
I'm expecting a great windfall,[N]
waiting for us at the world's end.[AN]
A vast collection of treasure rests[N]
there, beyond any of our imagination[Beat][N]
And you'll get the first cut, Ponte.[AN]
[FL]
Wow, really? That's real kind of you.[N]
I agree to your terms, Captain Lua![AN]
It's a pleasure doin' business with ya![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_2_2
[ML][LoadPilar]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML]
What a sap[Beat] The world's end?[AN]
He'll never see that fortune[N]
in this lifetime. Clever, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat][N]
[Beat][AN]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]So you actually mean what you said?[AN]
You plan on sailing into uncharted[N]
lands, and you kept that to yourself?[AN]
[MR]
You make it sound like I meant[N]
to keep a secret from the crew.[AN]
I meant to tell everyone else sooner,[N]
but with everything going on recently,[N]
we had bigger problems to worry about.[AN]
[ML]
With all due respect, let us decide[N]
which issue weighs more heavily.[AN]
Especially if it means that we[N]
must venture into the Old World,[N]
where maps cannot protect us.[AN]
[MR]
You know, for someone giving me grief[N]
about my secrets, you're hiding plenty[N]
of them yourself. The [OQ]Old World[CQ][Beat][AN]
I've never heard anyone call the lands[N]
uncharted on any map by that name.[N]
Where did you happen upon it, Pilar?[AN]
[ML][2LB]
In my youth, I too wished[N]
to escape Incendivis's reaches.[AN]
Not for treasure, like you,[N]
but for freedom from its grip.[AN]
That term[Beat] I learned it there.[A]
[MR]
Then why did you come back?[AN]
Surely you found what you[N]
were looking for there.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]Perhaps. Regardless,[N]
the decision is yours to make.[AN]
But if you wish to succeed in whatever[N]
it is that you chase, listen well:[AN]
do not venture into the Old World[N]
with a half-hearted resolve,[N]
or this crew will pay for it.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Of course, Pilar.[N]
Speaking of, can you gather[N]
the rest of the crew for me?[AN]
I'll[Beat] I'll tell them my goals,[N]
and they can decide whether to stick[N]
around. Ah, that includes you, too.[AN]
[ML]
Relax, I have no intent to leave.[N]
I've grown[Beat] fond, of this crew,[N]
and our journeys across the sky.[AN]
Besides, you need my knowledge[N]
more than anyone else's here,[N]
if we're heading into the Old World.[AN]
[MR]
I'm glad to hear it, Pilar.[N]
[Beat]Everyone else feels the same,[N]
I'm sure. We all rely on you.[AN]
[ML][2LB]
Well, I'm not growing any younger,[N]
so you should lean on me a bit less.[AN]
Still, I appreciate the sentiment.[N]
I[Beat] rely on all of you, too.[AN]
[MR]
[Beat][AN]
[ML]
[Beat]Well, good talk.[N]
I'll be going now.[AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MR]
Pilar's capable of embarrassment?[AN]
I just keep learning new things today,[N]
ha! I'll have to write this one down[Beat][A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_1
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Looks like everyone's finally made it.[N]
Good news: There's no sign of T.O.R.C.H.,[N]
so we should be in the clear for now.[AN]
Clear enough to decide on a new path.[N]
My vote is to continue flying[N]
deeper into the outskirts,[AN]
but I'd like to hear more thoughts[N]
before I explain my goals here.[AN]
Would anyone like to start?[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[ML][LoadRazvan]
I can begin the discussion, Captain Lua.[N]
In my view, our daring escape from[N]
Port Greagor leaves us little choice.[AN]
We'll have bounties on our heads,[N]
and, if we turn around, Imperial[N]
Marines eager to hunt them.[AN]
But if we stay in the outskirts and keep[N]
our heads down, our bounties won't rise.[AN]
Speaking from experience, Incendivis[N]
presence here is minimal, and laws lack[N]
enforcement. Pirates rove each port[Beat][AN]
Ugh, it makes me sick thinking of it.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
Too bad. Sounds like heaven to me![AN]
But from my time in the Roseblades,[N]
there're more empire-hating goons out[N]
here, tryin' to make their own country.[AN]
I've got a score to settle with[N]
one of 'em, and if they're anywhere,[N]
this is where I'll find the bastard.[AN]
So yeah, I've got plenty of reason[N]
to stick around. Count me in, boss![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[ML][LoadPilar]
[Beat]I also have no objections, Lua.[N]
However, Razvan is only correct[N]
under normal circumstances.[AN]
T.O.R.C.H. likely hasn't stopped[N]
searching for us.[A] The Imperial[N]
Marines, with ships of supplies,[N]
head the same direction we do.[AN]
We won't truly be free of their[N]
reach unless we go even further,[N]
into the skies unknown to man.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MR][LoadLua]
Pilar makes an important point.[AN]
There's been a clear increase[N]
in empire activity in the outskirts,[N]
with plenty of supplies. My guess?[AN]
They're searching for something[N]
out here, something of value.[N]
I don't know what it is, exactly.[AN]
It could be a hoard of gold,[N]
or priceless artifacts,[N]
or even the Fire Emblem![AN]
What I know, though, is that I want[N]
to snatch it right under their noses,[N]
and that's exactly what I intend to do.[AN]
There's a possibility that this could[N]
lead us into currently uncharted lands,[N]
with all the danger that implies[Beat][AN]
If the rest of you have something[N]
to say, speak up. Now's the time.[A][X]

// Scene 3
// Each of the crew collected so far say their piece; Orlando and Rahel start, the rest of the crew (if alive).

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_2_Orlando
[ML][LoadOrlando][3LB]
Well, you know my thoughts already, Lua.[N]
I fully support this venture,[N]
both with my heart and my coinpurse.[AN]
I have a wide array of basic goods[N]
for purchase at the fairest of prices,[N]
should the crew have any need for it.[AN]
My grace may make my profits plummet,[N]
but your gratitude is payment enough[Beat][N]
For now. I'll expect restitution later.[A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_2_Rahel
[ML][LoadRahel]
If we're going in somewhere blind,[N]
then our airships better be up to par.[AN]
I'll do a sweep around the new ones[N]
and report any flaws that I see.[AN]
You better not balk at the bill,[N]
captain. Safety doesn't come cheap.[A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_3
[MR][LoadLua][3LB]
Ha! I[Beat] I have to say, I expected[N]
at least one of you to want out.[AN]
But if not, that matter's settled![AN]
Now that we have a united goal,[N]
we're not just a band tied together[N]
by convenience. We're a crew![AN]
And a proper crew deserves a proper name.[AN]
A name that represents who we are,[N]
a band of pirates flying across[N]
the sky for treasure and adventure.[AN]
From today on, we're the Skysabers![AN]
[Beat]I'm not the creative type,[N]
but hopefully, this'll do.[AN]
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
Not bad at all, boss.[N]
It's no Roseblades,[N]
but it'll do just fine![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MR]
Ahem[Beat] With that done, let's get[N]
to the fun part. The privateer who[N]
owned this boat was a careful sort[Beat][AN]
He had enough food stores in here[N]
to last a fortnight, or longer![AN]
But he's got no need for them anymore,[N]
and we're finally in safe skies.[N]
Let's put them to good use, shall we?[AN]
It's time for a feast to celebrate[N]
our freedom, our friends, and our future![AN]
Don't leave a single plate[N]
unfinished, you hear me?[AN]
And tonight's a special occasion,[N]
so you can drink as much as you like![AN]
I'll handle the ship's navigation,[N]
so let's ring in our new crew[N]
with a night we'll never forget![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_4
[ML][LoadPilar][3LB]
So you have it handled, Lua?[N]
Maybe I'll unwind a bit,[N]
just this once[Beat][AN][X]


## HubB_BeginningScene_3_5
[ML][LoadRazvan][3LB]
If I'm to be among pirates, then[N]
I may as well celebrate like one.[N]
Three cheers for Captain Lua![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_6
Captain Lua![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_3_7
CAPTAIN LUA![A][X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_4_1
A few days later...[X]

## HubB_BeginningScene_4_2
[MidRight][LoadLuaHatless][ToggleMouthMove]
(Ahhhh... It feels like the post-feast[N]
hangover has finally worn off for me.[AN]
And hopefully, the actual hangovers[N]
have faded away for the others, too.[AN]
It's about time to begin scouting[N]
for any points of interest out here.[AN]
I doubt we'll find any Fire Emblem[N]
while we're still in charted lands,[AN]
but I'll go ask around and see if[N]
anyone's seen something interesting.)[A][X]

[ML][LoadDesiderio]
[MR][LoadLua]
[ML][1LB]
Captain. Do you have a moment?[A]
[MR][2LB]
We've no shortage of time[N]
out here. Say your piece.[A]
[ML][3LB]
With how big the armada's gotten,[N]
our supplies just can't keep up.[A][N]
I know Pilar has a plan[N]
to get us some fresh water,[A][N]
but all the water in the sky[N]
can't take the place of a[N]
hearty meal or sturdy hull.[A]
[MR][2LB]
That's a problem, all right.[A][N]
And with our scale, we'll need to[N]
find a proper port to restock[Beat][A][N]
but out here?[A]
[ML]
[Beat]I've already been looking into it.[A][N]
Asked Pilar for some help.[A][N]
And she found a place not far[N]
from here called Port Receloso.[A]
[MR]
A port all the way on the[N]
outskirts of the Empire[Beat][A][N]
It'd have to be quiet, at least.[A]
[ML]
A quiet frontier port? I[N]
think you mean [OpenQuote]too" quiet.[A][N]
No way somewhere out here[N]
is as safe as it looks.[A]

So if we go there,[AN]
we'd definitely need to[N]
prepare for trouble[Beat][A][X]

Boss, you got a minute to talk?[AN]
I've got a destination for the crew[N]
in mind, if you'll take requests.[AN]
[MR]
You'd know more about these[N]
parts than me, so shoot.[AN]
[ML][3LB]
Right[Beat] Well, there's a little[N]
island nearby called Snowthorne.[AN]
The name comes from what you'd guess.[N]
Never seen the place with less than[N]
six inches of snow on the ground.[AN]
But yeah, my old crew, the Roseblades,[N]
used to hang around an old fort there.[AN]
[Beat]It all went to hell when T.O.R.C.H.[N]
showed up, off a tip given by a traitor[N]
in the crew. I've mentioned this, right?[A]
[MR][2LB]
You have. Where's this going,[N]
and how does it benefit us?[AN]
[ML][3LB]
You'd see where it's goin'[N]
if you let me finish, boss.[N]
After the attack, they left real quick.[AN]
Probably didn't want to hang around[N]
in the cold and risk us striking back.[AN]
I hung around for a little, along with[N]
a couple other survivors from our crew.[AN]
But they all left, one by one, til[N]
it was me and one other guy[Beat][N]
Wouldn't be surprised if he stayed.[AN]
Anyway, we had a huge stockpile[N]
of fuel, what with the cold weather.[AN]
That fuel can be used for airships,[N]
and if we're going into the unknown,[N]
we need as much as we can get.[AN]
I say we swing by there and grab[N]
it for ourselves, if you're up for it.[A]
[MR]
That does sound tempting, Desiderio.[N]
But what of that man? You don't think[N]
he could have taken the rest and ran?[AN]
[ML]
Nah, no way. If he's got anything,[N]
it's a sense of honor[Beat] of duty.[N]
He'll still be there, I'm sure.[AN]
And if he's not, no one else would[N]
find the fuel. We've got it locked up,[N]
and only he and I know how to get it.[AN]
So long as he doesn't put up a fight,[N]
it'll be free to take for ourselves.[N]
[Beat]Well, what do you say, boss?[A][X]

[MR][LoadLua]
It doesn't seem fully reliable,[N]
but the reward is something else[Beat][AN]
I'm in. We'll sail there tomorrow,[N]
so get the route for the trip ready.[AN]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
I figured you were up for a gamble.[AN]
I'm not the best navigator around,[N]
but you can leave it to me, boss![AN]
[MR]
Good. I'm counting on you, like always.[N]
For this, and the battles to come.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat]Heh, praise from the boss?[N]
Now I really can't let her down.[AN][ToggleSmile]
Whatever's waiting for us there,[N]
I'll settle my business in Snowthorne[N]
and leave it all behind[Beat] for good.[A][X]

[ML][1LB]
Ah! Lua,[.4] have you got a moment?[A]

[MR][2LB]
Sure, not much else to do[N]
but watch the clouds roll here.[A]

[ML][3LB]
We're not too far off of one of[N]
the more substantial towns out[N]
here in this wasteland.[AN]
Perhaps while we're still in a[Beat][N]
somewhat civilised land it might[N]
be worth visiting for trade and supplies.[A]

[MR][2LB]
Is that right Orlando?[AN]
Hm,[.4] I suppose it would be prudent.[AN]
after all who knows how long it'll be[N]
before we see anywhere with real trade again.[AN]
Of course you and I know this is still[N]
quite far out from the usual trade routes.[AN]
They'll probably want to fleece us for[N]
all we're worth especially given our status.[A]

[ML][3LB]
Come now Lua we're both veterans of the[N]
merchants guild,[.4] I'm sure we can[N]
swindle ourselves a good deal.[AN]
Besides it would certainly make for[N]
a good break from all this endless fighting.[A]

[MR]
Hmm[Beat] I suppose so.[X]

## HubB4Accepted
[ML][LoadOrlando]
[MR][LoadLua][2LB]
Alright Orlando you made your case.[A]
We could do with something less[Beat] Intensive[N]
and we'll definetly need some money and gear.[A]

[ML][1LB]
Excellent, I'll make preparations right away.[A][X]

## HubB4Rejected
[ML][LoadOrlando]
[MR][LoadLua][2LB]

I think we have more pressing matters[N]
but I'll think about it.[A][X]

Bad news, Captain.[A]
[MR]
Oh?[A]
[ML][2LB]
I'll get straight to the[N]
point. We're being followed.[A]
[MR]
I should've known we wouldn't[N]
get clear of TORCH that easily[Beat][A][N]
Pilar, who exactly are our pursuers?[A]
[ML]
An airship. Bristling with weapons,[N]
but not flying a single banner.[A][N]
Pirates, maybe. Or the Empire's[N]
dogs trying some stratagem.[A][N]
Either way, they don't mean well.[A]
[MR]
We'll need to get these[N]
pursuers off our tail, then.[A][N]
The armada is too slow to[N]
confront them with broadsides,[A][N]
so we'll need some other way[Beat][A]
[ML]
On that note. I have a[N]
suggestion, if you'll take it.[A][N]
Our route near Port Receloso flies[N]
by an island called the Ghostwood.[A]
[MR]
I've not heard of it before[Beat][N]
but the name sounds dangerous.[A]
[ML]
Rumors say it's haunted.[A][N]
Ghostly illusions trap travelers[N]
and devour their souls,[A][N]
never to be seen again.[A]
[MR]
[ToggleSmile]I didn't take you to believe[N]
in ghost stories, Pilar.[ToggleSmile][A]
[ML]
[CloseEyes]After the sort of things[N]
we've seen out here?[A][N]
Hard to say.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]In any case, we know for sure the[N]
Ghostwood is a dangerous battleground.[A][N]
If we can land there, and force[N]
our pursuers to do the same[Beat][A][N]
then we might just be able[N]
to turn the odds against them.[A]
[MR][3LB]
Maybe we can stay for a while[N]
in the Ghostwood afterwards, too.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]All the sea shanties agree,[N]
a haunted place like that's[N]
got to hold some great treasure.[ToggleSmile][A]
[ML]
We can look for plunder, too.[A][N]
But all the gold in the sky[N]
won't do us any good if that[N]
airship shoots us down.[A][N]
Well, Captain? What's the plan?[A][X]

## HubB5Accepted
[ML][LoadPilar]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR]
The longer we let that[N]
airship stay on our tail,[AN]
the more chances it'll get[N]
to strike when we're weak.[AN]
Show me the way to[N]
the Ghostwood, Pilar.[A]
[ML]
Certainly.[A][N]
If we just veer off course[N]
southeast, drop ten degrees[Beat][A][X]

## HubB5Rejected
[ML][LoadPilar]
[MR][LoadLua]
[MR][1LB]
I have an alternative idea.[A]
[ML]
What is it?[A]
[MR][3LB]
We're not in short supply of[N]
points of interest to land at.[A][N]
This Ghostwood is promising,[N]
but we can't risk going too far[N]
off course for it quite yet.[A][N]
Let's try our other destinations,[N]
and see if they take the[N]
bait in one of those.[A][N]
The Ghostwood's treasure[N]
will just have to wait.[A]
[ML][2LB]
Bringing some port or ruin into[N]
this is an unnecessary risk[Beat][AN]
but it's your call, Captain.[N]
You've not led us wrong before.[A][X]
