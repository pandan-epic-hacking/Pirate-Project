[MR]
C-Captain Lua![N]
It's bad![A][N]
Oh, it's bad![A]
[ML]
Hm? You're[Beat] Dario,[N]
that town guard, right?[A][N]
What's the issue?[A]
[MR]
Lady Magdalena,[N]
she[Beat] she's dead![A][N]
I found her in the woods,[N]
stabbed like Father Gavriel![A]
[ML]
Damn! This must be the[N]
work of the murderer[Beat][A][N]
but I thought we[N]
already imprisoned-[A]
[MR]
And Cruz fled town![A][N]
He ran out into the[N]
woods and never came back![A]
[ML]
So, we[Beat] we pinned the[N]
blame on the wrong person.[A][N]
At least our supplies are-[A][CSSCF]
[MR][MoveFarRight]
[R][LoadLua]
[ML][LoadPilar]
[ML]
Captain Lua.[N]
Looks like things went wrong.[A]
[R][1LB]
[CloseEyes]Oh, for the love of the Maker[Beat][A][OpenEyes]
[ML][3LB]
The supplies Lady[N]
Magdalena was supposed to[N]
give us have gone missing.[A][N]

[FL][1LB]
That's me![A][CSSCF]
[L][MoveMidLeft]
[ML][2LB]
-said she saw a griffin rider[N]
flying away with those crates.[A]
[R][3LB]
Hah[Beat] I'd expect those two[N]
things are connected, then.[A][N]
Even in death, the[N]
good Lady Magdalena still[N]
leaves us no choice[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
In death?[A][N]
Guessing that's what that[N]
soldier's so worked up about?[A]
[FR]
I-it's Dario.[A][N]
And[Beat] and Cruz killed[N]
Lady Magdalena and fled![A]
[ML]
It was Cruz? Bah.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]Let myself get too[N]
focused on that soldier,[A][N]
and missed the real threat[Beat][OpenEyes][A]
[R]
If our supplies are gone[N]
and the port's leader is dead,[A][N]
then we've no time to waste.[A][N]
Pilar, where did that griffin fly?[A]
[ML]
To the east.[A][N]
The Rebels have some[N]
hideout in a ruined fort.[A][CSS]
[ML][MoveLeft]
[FL][LoadDesiderio]
[FL]
Not much of a secret.[A][N]
It's the only other point[N]
of interest on this island,[A][N]
and they didn't do[N]
much to hide the thing.[A]
[R]
Then our plan is clear.[A][N]
Desiderio, ready the crew for battle.[N]
We'll sweep that Rebel hideout![A]
[FL][1LB]
[ToggleSmile]Don't need to tell me twice![A][ToggleSmile]

I[Beat] I'll keep the town safe.[A][N]
Please, Captain Lua[Beat][N]
avenge Magdalena![A][X]

[MR]
Captain Lua.[N]
Looks like things went wrong.[A]
[ML]
As they always do.[N]
What's the matter, Pilar?[A]
[MR][3LB]
The supplies Lady[N]

give us have gone missing.[A][N]
One of the villagers-[A][CSS]

flying away with those crates.[A]
[ML]
We need those supplies if[N]
we're to get much farther[Beat][A][N]
Time to catch a thief, then.[N]
Where did that griffin fly?[A]

[MR][LoadMagdalena]
[MR]
[HalfCloseEyes]Good Captain[Beat]![A][N]
I am unused[Beat][N]
to running so fast[Beat][A]
[FL]
Lady Magdalena?[N]
What's happening?[A]
[MR]
It's Cruz.[A][N]
He[Beat] he escaped from[N]
gaol in the night,[A][N]
with the help of[N]
some outside friend.[A]
[FL][1LB]
[CloseEyes]Oh, for the love of the Maker[Beat][A][OpenEyes]
[L][2LB]
[Beat]Did that [OpenQuote]outside friend"[N]
ride a griffin, by chance?[A]
[MR]
Perhaps[Beat] there were prints[N]
and feathers on my roof,[A][N]
that could fit that image.[A]
[FL]
Hah[Beat] then our two[N]
problems are connected.[A][N]
That griffin rider[N]
stole our supplies, too.[A][CSS]
[MR][MoveRight]
[FR][LoadDesiderio]
[FR]
And I think I know[N]
where they took 'em.[A]
[FL][1LB]
Oh?[A]
[L][2LB]
The Rebels have some[N]
hideout in a ruined fort.[A]
[FR]
It's the only other point[N]
of interest on this island,[A][N]
and we know Cruz is friends[N]
with that nest's local rats.[A]
[L][3LB]
For the record, I still[N]
think we should've stolen[N]
the supplies from the start.[A]
[FL][2LB]
[CloseEyes]Not the time, Pilar[Beat][A][N]
[OpenEyes]Still, our plan is clear.[A][N]
Desiderio, ready the crew for battle.[N]
We'll sweep that Rebel hideout![A]

Wait! You are[Beat] Captain Lua![A]
[MR][2LB]
And you're[Beat] that[N]
thief from town? Husniye?[A]
[ML]
[Beat]You did not blame me,[N]
like all those others did.[A][N]
You[Beat] you may somehow[N]
have somewhere I belong.[A]
[MR]
Are you saying you[N]
want to join my crew?[A]
[ML]
Yes[Beat] I am.[A][N]
I know your band has many[N]
misfits and outcasts[Beat][A][N]
[CloseEyes]This town has no place for me.[A][N]
It never did.[A][N]
[Beat][OpenEyes]But might you, Captain?[A]
[MR][1LB]
Can you fight?[A]
[ML][2LB]
I am no soldier, but[N]
with a knife[Beat] I can try.[A][N]
And, perhaps, provide aid and[N]
comfort outside of the fray[Beat][A][N]
for such is always what[N]
I have been better at.[A]
[MR]
Good enough for me.[N]
Welcome to my crew, Husniye.[A][N]
Pilar there, in the shadows,[N]
will keep an eye on you.[A][N]
We're moving out.[A][X]

Captain Lua[Beat][N]
Please. Wait for me.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]Avocado?[N]
What are you doing?[A]
[ML]
[Beat]I heard the news.[A][N]
I saw Lady Magdalena's[N]
corpse with my own eyes.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]This is what comes of[N]
my refusal to fight[Beat][A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat][A]
[ML][2LB]
[OpenEyes]I have readied what[N]
remains of my gear.[A][N]
Let me fight with you.[A]
[MR][3LB]
We could always use[N]
another lance arm,[N]
but[Beat] you? Why?[A][N]
Last thing I heard, you[N]
had sworn off war forever.[A]
[ML][3LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]Lady Magdalena did[N]
not deserve this death.[A][N]
Neither did Father Gavriel,[N]
nor any of the others.[A][N]
They were no fighters,[N]
yet they perished nontheless.[A][N]
[Beat]If someone must bleed[N]
and die, let it be me,[N]
he who deserves it most.[A][N]
Let it be all those with[N]
innocent blood on their hands.[A][OpenEyes]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat][CloseEyes]I still don't like having[N]
a former T.O.R.C.H. soldier with us,[A][N]
but if needs must[Beat][A][N]
[OpenEyes]You report to Desiderio,[N]
in the eyepatch there.[A][N]
We're moving out.[A][X]

[MidRight][LoadRazvan]
[MR]
[Beat]Lady Magdalena?[N]
You're coming with us?[A]
[ML]
[Beat][CloseEyes]It was my negligence that[N]
let this threat fester[Beat][A][N]
that let Cruz escape.[A][N]
[Beat]I see now the[N]
error of my ways.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]I must fight.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]I must end this[N]
once and for all.[A]
[MR]
If that's a risk you're[N]
willing to take[Beat][A][N]
[ToggleSmile]I'm sure Captain Lua[N]
would appreciate your help.[ToggleSmile][A]
[ML]
I need not her appreciation[Beat][A][N]
only her forgiveness, and[N]
the strength of her blade.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]I'm sure you'll[N]
get those, soon enough.[AN]
Let's go.[AN]
The rest of the crew[N]

## B2_IntroCruz_Monologue
[ML][LoadCruz][3LB]
[Beat]Well.[N]
That could've gone better.[A][N]
But at least I'm alive out here,[N]
and the ruins still stand[Beat][A][N]
We'll need a new plan.[N]
Some new way to operate[Beat][A][N]
maybe we can take a ship[N]
from that pirate crew?[A][N]
Set out to the open skies,[N]
and join up with our[N]
brethren elsewhere?[A][X]


## B2_IntroCruz_Thieves

like what I have to say[Beat][A]
[MR]
Yadney?[N]
What[Beat] what is it?[A]
[ML]
We're under attack.[A][N]
That pirate captain[N]
you mentioned in town[Beat][A][N]
her crew's kicking in[N]
the doors as we speak.[A]
[MR]
But why would they come after us?[A][N]
I know they can't be on[N]
Port Receloso's payroll.[A][N]
Unless[Beat] those saddlebags[Beat][A]
[ML][1LB]
Er[Beat][A]
[MR][2LB]
Yadney, why in the Maker's name[N]
did you steal the damn supplies?!?[A][N]
If there's one thing[N]
that makes pirates mad,[A][N]
it's stealing from them![A]
[ML]
Look, we need food too![A][N]
There's not much to forage[N]
out here in the woods![A]
[MR]
Ugh[Beat][A][N]
If we both survive this, I'll[N]
have a lecture or two to give.[A][N]
For now? We have to fight.[A]
[ML][3LB]
I'll take the front.[A][N]
Our men will unite around[N]
my spear, and we'll swoop[N]
through like a storm![A]
[MR][2LB]
The men[Beat] Damn it![A][N]
It's still early[N]

so they're still sleeping![A][N]

rouse every Rebel in the fort![A][N]
You've no time to waste![A]
[ML][1LB]
And as for me?[A]
[MR][2LB]
Swoop in, like you said.[A][N]
We may be out of position now[Beat][N]
but you can still break them.[A][N]

[Beat][CloseEyes]So this is truly happening[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]I have never liked you, Cruz.[AN]

They're all fighting and[N]
dying outside, while I[Beat][A][N]
I just wait back in here,[N]
cast my magic, and plan![A][N]
[Beat][CloseEyes]This cannot continue.[N]
[OpenEyes][ToggleRed]I must take the field myself[ToggleRed].[A][N]
Yadney, are you still there?[N]
I shall fight at your side![A][X]



## B2_BQ_YadneyDesiderio
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
Rebel scum[Beat] I've fought[N]
you before, haven't I?[A][N]
In the battle off Rockwell?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
Mm. That place rings a bell.[A][N]
Roseblade Pirates,[N]
by any chance?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadDesiderio]
[Beat][CloseEyes]You've no right[N]
to say that name.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]I'll grind you to paste and[N]
throw your bones to the dogs![A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
You'll need to catch me first.[N]
And in that armor?[AN]
Fat chance![A][X]

## B2_BQ_YadneyRazvan
[MR][LoadRazvan]
I don't know who[N]
you are, but[Beat][A][N]
why are you doing this?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
Doing what, exactly?[A][N]
Fighting for the Rebels?[N]
Or gutting you like a fish?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadRazvan]
I[Beat] [CloseEyes]might imagine how[N]
Incendivis has wronged you.[A][N]
But how can that justify[N]
living in these ruins,[A][N]
stealing from innocent[N]
villagers and merchants[Beat][A][N]
[OpenEyes]all of this?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
[CloseEyes]Those dastards from T.O.R.C.H.[N]
burned my hometown to the ground.[A][N]
Left me nothing to do but[N]
cut them up a bit in return.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]And I'll cut you[N]
up too, healer boy,[A][N]
don't think I won't![A][X]

## B2_BQ_YadneyPilar
[MR][LoadPilar]
Your plan needs work.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
Just who the[N]
hell are you?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
Hiding out in ruins[N]
isn't an awful idea,[A][N]
but you didn't even fix[N]
the holes in the walls.[A][N]
And you don't have an airship[N]
docked as an escape plan.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
Look, Cruz is the one who does[N]
this planning stuff, okay?[A][N]
I'm just the muscle.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
If you want to take a[N]
crack at the Empire,[A][N]
you'll need to do a[N]
lot better than this.[A][N]
Shame you won't[N]
have the chance.[A][X]

## B2_BQ_YadneyAvocado
[ML][LoadYadney]
That armor[Beat][N]
that insignia[Beat][A][N]
I'd recognize it anywhere.[N]
You're a soldier from T.O.R.C.H.![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
You[Beat] you monstrous dastard![A][N]
Was my hometown not enough[N]
to sate your bloodlust?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
[Beat][CloseEyes]No. Nothing ever will be.[A][N]
No death save my own will[N]
quiet the voices in my dreams.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
Even if it costs my[N]
life, I will end you![A][N]
Right here, right now![A][N]
This is for my family!!![A][X]

## B2_BQ_YadneyLua
[MR][LoadLua]
So you're the one who[N]
took our supplies.[A][N]
Drop your lance[N]
and hand them over,[A][N]
and you can still fly[N]
out of this alive.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
You tried to lock away[N]
my leader[Beat] my friend.[A][N]
I won't hand Cruz over[N]
to the mercy of your blade.[A][N]
Not while I still have the[N]
strength to stand and fight![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
Then if it's a[N]
fight you want[Beat][A][X]

## B2_BQ_YadneyJaime
[MR][LoadJaime]
Hey, you! You're a[N]
rebel too, aren't you?[A][N]
What're you doing in this dump?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
I could ask the same.[A][N]
You're playing attack dog[N]
for some crew of pirates[Beat][A][N]
why?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadJaime]
See, that's a[N]
damn good question.[A][N]
But the long and short of[N]
it is, they're good folk.[A][N]
Helping out those in need.[A][N]
Now, I don't know if[N]
you are too, but[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
But I've better things to[N]
do than banter with you.[A][N]
If you're really a[N]
Rebel, as you say[Beat][A][N]
then you know what it means[N]
to die for the cause![A][X]

## B2_BQ_YadneyXimo
[ML][LoadYadney]
An archer, huh? Think[N]
you can shoot me down?[AN]
Well, you won't be so smug[AN]
once I've stuck a[N]
javelin through your heart![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadXimo]
I've got no intention[N]
of bowing down to you.[AN]
[Beat][ToggleSmile]Heh.[A][ToggleSmile][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
What's so funny?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadXimo]
It's just that I made[N]
an accidental pun.[AN]
Because, [OpenQuote]bow" down to you?[N]
And I'm an archer?[AN]
See? Get it?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
I don't get the joke.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadXimo]
Yeah, I didn't really[N]
expect you to, honestly.[A][X]

## B2_BQ_YadneyHusniye
[ML][LoadYadney]
Wait, you[Beat][A][N]
You're that wench who[N]
stole my coin purse![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadHusniye]
Maybe.[A][N]
I do not remember you.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
[CloseEyes]And here I thought we had[N]
something going, together[Beat][A][N]
Nothing but an excuse for[N]
you to fill your pockets.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]When I'm done from you, you'll[N]
never harm another soul![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadHusniye]
I see I should have stolen[N]
more than just your money.[A][N]
So I will take your[N]
life, right now.[A][X]

## B2_BQ_YadneyMagdalena
[MR][LoadMagdalena]
So you were the griffin rider[N]
who broke into my home[Beat][A][N]
Why do such a thing?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
You had my friend locked[N]
up. I had to free him.[A][N]
That's the start and[N]
the end of it all.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadMagdalena]
[Beat]What surprises me is that[N]
Cruz truly was[Beat] it all.[A][N]
You hurt no one during[N]
your rescue mission.[A][N]
[Beat]I was sleeping.[N]
Why not kill me then?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
Because I'm not a bad person.[A][N]
Or, at least, I try[N]
my best not to be.[A][N]
Cruz says his assassinations[N]
are doing the right thing[Beat][A][N]
but in my mind,[A][N]
the Maker can't abide killing[N]
someone who can't fight back.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadMagdalena]
And yet you lay your[N]
life down for Cruz.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadYadney]
Because he's right.[A][N]
I should've killed you,[N]
when I had the chance.[A][N]
And now we will![A][X]



## B2_BQ_YadneyGeneric
[ML][LoadYadney]
Think you stand a[N]
chance, you imperial scum?[AN]
[ToggleSmile]You're far too slow[N]

## B2_BQ_CruzAvocado
[MR][LoadAvocado]
[Beat]Cruz. You're the[N]
one behind all this.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
Avocado[Beat] you, of all[N]
people, have to understand.[AN]
What we're doing is right.[N]
The Imperials are monstrous.[A][N]
You know this![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
[Beat]And you know nothing.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
Hm?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
You slaughter innocent men[N]
in the dead of night.[A][N]
You have Lady Magdalena's[N]
blood on your hands.[A][N]
Do not pretend to[N]
be a good man, Cruz.[A][N]
Neither of us are.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
You have no right[N]
to say such a thing![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadAvocado]
I will concede one[N]
thing to Incendivis.[A][N]
They taught me how to kill.[A][N]
Now, traitor,[N]
murderer[Beat] come.[A][N]
Face the justice[N]
we both deserve![A][X]

## B2_BQ_CruzMagdalena
[MR][LoadMagdalena]
Enough, Cruz.[A][N]
Drop your tome, and you[N]
might yet keep your life.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
How can't you see,[N]
Lady Magdalena?[A][N]
How can't you see I'm[N]
doing the right thing?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadMagdalena]
All I can see is a madman killing[N]
the people of Port Receloso[Beat][A][N]
my town.[A][N]
I was too blind to realize[N]
it was you, but now[Beat][A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
I am no madman![A][N]
I am the only one[N]
who sees the truth![A][N]
And you, nothing but[N]
some broken old woman[Beat][A][N]
I had hoped to kill you[N]
too, during my escape.[A][N]
Now, I finish my task![A][X]

## B2_BQ_CruzHusniye
[ML][LoadCruz]
Damn it, Husniye[Beat][A][N]
You were supposed[N]
to take the fall![A][N]
Everyone should've expected a[N]
foreign thief to be the killer![A][N]
How[Beat][N]
how'd you end up here?!?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadHusniye]
I came to kill you.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
[Beat]Of course you did.[A][N]
I guess you need your[N]
righteous vengeance, after-[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadHusniye]
Stop talking.[A][N]
It will not save you, Cruz.[A][X]

## B2_BQ_CruzLua
[ML][LoadCruz]
Damn it[Beat] you're the[N]
reason it all went wrong![A][N]
If not for your intervention,[N]
I would've escaped![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
We were just stopping[N]
to restock on supplies.[A][N]
You were the one who[N]
dragged us into this mess.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
Then take what you need[N]
from Port Receloso by force.[A][N]
They would've deserved[N]
it, after all-[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
Nah. I'm not quite[N]
that kind of pirate.[A][N]
You, though? And your[N]
assembled gang of thieves?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
We're doing the right thing![A][N]
Fighting against the[N]
Empire's tyranny, and-[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLua]
And getting the hell[N]
out of our way. Die![A][X]

## B2_BQ_CruzLeonor
[ML][LoadCruz]
You won't take another step[Beat][A][N]
not so long as I still[N]
have a tome in hand![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLeonor]
Are you[Beat] Cruz d'Oliveira?[A][N]
You know, your writing[N]
was what inspired me[A][N]
to join the Rebels[N]
in the first place.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
Is that so? I[Beat] [CloseEyes]wasn't[N]
aware I had an audience.[A][N]
[OpenEyes]But if you know[N]
our cause is right[Beat][A][N]
what are you doing[N]
on the other side?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadLeonor]
In your books, you talked[N]
about high-minded ideals[Beat][A][N]
of the falling of the old[N]
to make room for the new.[A][N]
But put into practice[N]
in Port Receloso,[A][N]
your murders hardly live[N]
up to those ideals at all.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
[CloseEyes]Why, you[Beat][A][N]
You're just a healer![A][N]
You don't know what it means[N]
to put your life on the line![A][N]
But just like in my books[Beat][N]
[OpenEyes]I'll teach you that lesson![A][X]

## B2_BQ_CruzPilar
[ML][LoadCruz]
Some sort of spy?[A][N]
Are you really the best[N]
Lady Magdalena could send?[A][N]
Pah. You're nothing but[N]
another Imperial pawn![A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
Do you think you know what[N]
the rebellion even is?[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
What are you talking about?[A][N]
I've killed for the rebellion.[N]
My friends have died for it.[A][N]
We're all doing what it takes[A][N]
to free these beautiful skies[N]
from Incendivis's iron grip.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadPilar]
Doing what it takes? You're[N]
hardly doing anything at all.[A][N]
Too bad you won't live[N]
to make any real change.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
Then you'll be the one to[N]
die for your cause instead![A][X]

## B2_BQ_CruzOrlando
[ML][LoadCruz]
Imperial merchants like[N]
you make me sick.[A][N]
Throwing around coins like[N]
they're nothing but dirt,[A][N]
while ruining the livelihoods[N]
of anyone in your way.[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadOrlando]
Mm. You make a good point.[A][N]
I've a few business partners[N]
who fit that description.[A][CSSCF]
[ML][LoadCruz]
And let me guess.[A][N]
You think you're so[N]
much better than them?[A][CSSCF]
[MR][LoadOrlando]
Hard to say. But I know[N]
that compared to them,[A][N]
I'm much better at killing.[A][X]



## B2_BQ_CruzGeneric
[ML][LoadCruz]
It's all gone wrong[Beat][N]

Cruz[Beat]! No![AN]
[CloseEyes]It should've[N]
been me instead[Beat][AN]
[OpenEyes]Damn it all![AN]
[OpenEyes]I'll find some way out,[N]
fly far from this place.[AN]

[L]
Captain, we've found[N]
the stolen supplies.[A][N]
Looks like just about[N]
everything is accounted for.[A]
[FL]
And the rebels had some[N]
extra goods stashed here, too.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]They won't be needing them anymore.[ToggleSmile][A]
[MR]
That's a relief. It looks like[N]
they're all dead or fled[Beat][A]
[FL][1LB]
Should we give chase?[A]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat]No. We've wasted too much[N]
time on Port Receloso already.[A][N]
This was never our fight[Beat][A][N]
even if we did get some[N]
useful things out of it.[A]
[FL][3LB]
Speak for yourself.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile]Bashing a few of those[N]
hypocritical dastards is[N]
always a good thing to do[ToggleSmile].[A]
[L][2LB]
These were no real members[N]
of the Rebel movement[Beat][A][N]
just a pack of local pirates[N]
pretending to a higher cause.[A]
[FL]
Yeah, that's what the[N]
whole rebellion is, Pilar.[A]
[L]
As someone who's fought[N]
them before, as you claim,[A][N]
surely you see the[N]
difference between-[A]
[MR][3LB]
Enough.[A][N]
This place was halfway to[N]
crumbling even before we[N]
shook it with the fighting[Beat][A][N]
let's get our supplies[N]
and get out before the[N]
roof comes down on us.[A]
[FL][1LB]
[Beat]Sounds like a plan, Captain.[A][X]

You[Beat] I forget your name.[A]

[Beat]Husniye.[A]
[ML][2LB]
Ah. You, too, were a suspect[Beat][A][N]
until the pirate captain proved[N]
you were no murderer.[A]
[MR]
She was the only person in[N]
this whole town to listen[Beat][A][N]
though now that I remember,[A][N]
I have not talked[N]
to you much either.[A]
[ML][1LB]
[Beat]No. We haven't.[A]
[MR][2LB]
[Beat][A][N]
[Beat]So, Avocado, are you[N]
doing anything later?[A]
[ML]
[Beat]I know I cannot remain[N]
in Port Receloso any longer.[A][N]
It holds no true[N]
escape from my past.[A]
[MR]
On that, we agree,[N]
although my past was here.[A][N]
If you are looking to leave,[A][N]
perhaps we could join that[N]
pirate captain's crew?[A]
[ML]
[Beat]No.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]Every faction that[N]
lays claim to the sky[Beat][A][N]
Incendivis, the Rebels, and[N]
even the pirate crews[Beat][A][N]
share in a love[N]
for war and battle.[A][N]
That, above all, is[N]
what I have to flee[Beat][A]
[MR]
And you seek a peaceful place?[A]
[ML]
Aye[Beat] one far from[N]
these war-torn isles.[A][N]
If I were to seek it, Husniye[Beat][N]
[OpenEyes]would you come with me?[A]
[MR]
Somewhere peaceful, where[N]
no one knows my face or name[Beat][A][N]
[ToggleSmile]I would love to, Avocado.[A][X]

Captain Lua[Beat] I would[N]
ask one more favor of you.[A]
[ML]
We're just about to[N]
set sail. Make it quick.[A]
[MR]
[Beat]I would request[N]
to join your crew.[A]
[ML]
You've already proven your skill,[N]
in the battle in the ruins[Beat][A][N]
I could use a magician like you.[A][N]
But wouldn't that mean[N]
leaving Port Receloso behind?[A]
[MR][1LB]
[Beat]I already have.[A]
[ML]
What do you mean?[A]
[MR][3LB]
[Beat]If not for your intervention,[N]
I would surely have been[N]
Cruz's next victim.[A][N]
For I was the one on a mission[N]
to investigate his crimes[Beat][A][N]
[CloseEyes]I have failed my town already.[A][N]
They elected me to my place,[N]
and yet I failed them,[A][N]
totally and utterly.[A]
[ML][2LB]
Ah. So you think you were[N]
just incompetent as a governor.[A]
[MR]
Yes[Beat] I truly am.[A][N]
Thais and Quim, the[N]
barkeep and the acolyte,[A][N]
have already stepped up to[N]
lead Port Receloso in my stead.[A][N]
Both are far more[N]
capable than I[Beat][A][N]
I have already spoken to[N]
them, and announced my plans.[OpenEyes][A]
[ML]
[CloseEyes]So at this point, it would[N]
be harder for you to stay[Beat][A][N]

your change of career.[A][X]

At least the bastard's[N]
dead and gone now.[A][N]
[CloseEyes]Hopefully Father Gavriel[N]
can rest in peace[Beat][OpenEyes][A]

Dead. You can say [OpenQuote]dead".[A]

It'll probably be one of[N]
us two, given the situation[Beat][A]

Good luck with that.[A][N]
You'll need to do a lot to fix[N]
the place up, after all this.[A][N]
[Beat]By the by.[N]
What happened to Avocado?[A][N]
Is he still in jail?[A]
[FR]
[Beat]About that.[N]
He's gone completely mad.[A]
[ML][1LB]
What do you mean?[A]
[R][2LB]
[CloseEyes]We found the poor[N]
dear in his cell,[A][N]
muttering to himself[N]
about blood and death.[A][N]
When Dario unlocked it,[N]
he barely even noticed,[A][N]
and just kept on rambling[Beat][A][OpenEyes]
[FR]
I'm not the healer[N]
Father Gavriel was,[A][N]
and I'm certainly not[N]
too great at fixing minds.[A][N]
Maybe some passing ship will[N]
take him somewhere better,[A][N]
or maybe he'll just waste[N]
away here in Port Receloso[Beat][A]
[ML][3LB]
But whatever happens, it[N]
sounds like he's at least[N]
out of the picture for now.[A][N]
Quim, Thais, thank you both[N]
for your help with all this.[A][N]
Best of luck running the town.[A]
[R]
It was our pleasure.[A][N]
Oh, and would you like[N]

She snuck out to[Beat] somewhere.[A]

After another pointless[N]

ourselves doing good deeds.[A][N]
Too little gained,[N]

Yeah. Pilar was right, after[N]
all[Beat] at least about this.[A][N]
If we had just[N]
left Port Receloso alone,[A][N]
or taken the supplies without[N]
getting involved in the murders[Beat][A][N]
maybe Lady Magdalena[N]
wouldn't have had to die.[A]

I'm not mad at you,[N]
