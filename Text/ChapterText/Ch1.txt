//Chapter 1 of Pirate Project
// CENTRAL CHARACTERS

// Lua - The captain and lord. A former merchant who worked her way up in the Merchants Guild and amassed prestige, she lost everything in a raid of her ship.
// She begged the Imperial Navy for aid in hunting the thieves, but they refused, citing more important matters to deal with than one merchant's losses.
// With most of her fortune gone, and a newfound bitterness towards authority, she set sail for the outskirts of the empire to track down the raiders herself.
// However, she soon found that she enjoyed the lifestyle of the outer islands, where Empire personnel is sparse, and sailing the skies at her leisure.
// After punishing the thieves and regaining her stolen possessions, she sold them all and began amassing a crew, with no goal in particular save freedom.

// However, when she meets her mentor again after everything in her life has changed, his words stir a new purpose within her:
// "In the furthest reaches of the world, even beyond the Empire, tales speak of fathomless riches. And perhaps, even the Fire Emblem itself."
// Spurred by an adventurous spirit, Lua sails across the skies, charting unknown territory in search of the legendary artifact.

// Pilar - Lua's first crewmate and the navigator of her crew. Her past is shrouded in mystery, as her tale changes each time she tells it,
// but her knowledge of ships surpasses Lua's own. She shares her captain's distaste of life in the Empire and criticizes the Empire's morals at any chance,
// claiming to have grown up in its heart. This is where her knowledge of sailing comes from, as well as her disgust for her former home.
// Her combat prowess, however, is something she provides little explanation for, and she often seems to know more than she lets on.
// In truth, she was a prominent rebel in her youth, and though she left the cause long ago, her passion has yet to cool.

// Desiderio - The quartermaster of Lua's crew, he acts as her second-in-command. An old hand at pirating, he fills in for her knowledge gaps in their "trade."
// Claims he became a pirate after running away from home because he "didn't want to eat his vegetables." He is skilled in a variety of necessities on a ship,
// such as carpenting and cooking. He once was the quartermaster of the Roseblade Pirates, a prominent pirate crew that often fought with rebel forces over turf,
// and he lost a number of comrades in these battles. However, his deepest rage is reserved for an old friend who betrayed the crew and led to their destruction,
// before disappearing. Although Desiderio follows Lua in part out of respect, he also hopes that he will find his most hated enemy in their travels.

// Razvan - A young man who grew up on an island in the outer isles. His goal, impressed onto him by his mother, was to escape the fate of so many around him,
// doomed to live on the island in squalor. He learned to read quickly with his mother's urging, and this aptitude earned him the attention of the clergy.
// A local priest soon taught Razvan to use a staff, and his aptitude and drive impressed Empire envoys that were visiting the small church Razvan practiced in.
// Despite his youth, he was able to study under an Imperial Healer. On his first real mission, he and imperial troops answered a marooned ship's plea for aid.
// However, it was a ruse by the Blackheart Pirates, who stole the imperial ship and left Razvan and company for dead. Luckily, Lua came across his group,
// saving them from a gruesome fate. Razvan left his post and budding career behind, choosing to follow Lua to repay her for saving him that day.

// MEAT FOR THE GRINDER

// Carmen - A flamboyant magus who claims to be an expert musician, but has a horrible singing voice. She fled from her lofty home in the Empire's capital,
// supposedly a member of the noble del Rias family (if she can be believed). The crew's musician, and more often, can be found swabbing the deck.

// Ximo - A man around Razvan's age who grew up in a port town. Lua found him desperately searching for a job and hired him despite her better judgement,
// having Desiderio teach him carpentry. The chief deck swabber and scout, he sends much of his money back to his family and hopes to show the crew his worth.

[FarLeft][LoadDesiderio]
[Left][LoadPilar]
[Right][LoadLuaHatless]
[FarRight][LoadRazvan]
[Right][3LB]
Well, Desiderio? Do you yield?[AN]
With these cards in my hand,[N]
you have no chance of victory.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Do I look the type to fold?[AN]
If you've got a flush, I've got two eyes.[N]
No, I won't back down. I'll call![AN]
[Left][2LB]
I hadn't thought you so eager[N]
to give away a week's pay.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Heh! When this game's done,[N]
I'll have gained a month's![AN]
[FarRight]
I'm not sure that math works out[Beat][N]
You should listen to Miss Pilar.[AN]
[Right]
Now, now, Razvan. Let Desiderio[N]
do as he pleases. After all,[AN]
I couldn't possibly have[Beat][N]
these five in my hand, right?[AN]
[FarLeft]
Y-You[Beat] You cheated me![AN]
That's no ordinary flush,[N]
that's a damn straight![AN]
[Right]
Lying is all part of the game,[N]
right? You can't begrudge me that.[AN]
Now, you owe me five hundred gold.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Grr[Beat] Fine, then have it.[AN]
I was going to buy a new axe,[N]
but I don't need it anyhow.[AN]
[Left]
Now that that's settled,[N]
we should discuss our route.[AN]
I'm happy to report that the skies[N]
look clear, and the winds steady.[AN]
We should reach Port Greagor within[N]
a few days, provided it stays this way.[AN]
[Right][3LB]
Glad to hear it. Our little detour[N]
deeper into the empire's lands[N]
took longer than I expected,[AN]
but hopefully, it was worth it.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Of course it was! That Golden Cross[N]
crew lived up to their name,[N]
with all the booty in their stores.[AN]
It almost matched the hoard[N]
of our fat cat-ptain here.[AN]
[Left][1LB]
[Beat]A new low, hm?[AN]
[FarRight][3LB]
[Beat]Regardless, I certainly thought it[N]
was worth the journey, Captain Lua.[AN]
It's been a long time since I saw empire[N]
lands that weren't lawless outskirts[Beat][N]
The Incendivis Empire is a big place.[AN]
[Left]
Do I hear wistfulness in that voice,[N]
Razvan? Personally, I couldn't leave[N]
quick enough.[A] So much opulence[Beat][N]
There, that veneer of wealth[N]
defines you, not your own deeds.[AN]
Every little thing you do is watched[N]
by imperial officers who have far too[N]
much power over the lives of people.[AN]
[FarRight]
I respect your outlook, but they let[N]
a poor child from the outskirts like me[N]
apprentice with an Imperial Healer.[AN]
I wouldn't have half my talent with[N]
a staff without that generosity,[N]
so I can't just ignore that, Miss Pilar.[AN]
Without the empire's presence, you get[N]
the outer isles and its many pirates,[N]
who'll kill you for a single doubloon.[AN]
Ah, not all of them! You all are kind.[N]
But if Captain Lua hadn't saved me from[N]
the Blackhearts, I'd be crow food by now.[AN]
[FarLeft]
True, some pirates are dastards, but some[N]
have their own code, one they uphold more[N]
than the empire enforces its fancy laws.[AN]
Just takes a bag of gold from a merchant,[N]
and their watchful gaze stays well shut.[AN]
But hey, it's easier to be bought out[N]
than risk making a powerful enemy.[N]
Who knows what I'd do in their shoes?[AN]
Now, the so-called rebels, they're the[N]
real sorry sods. They're no better than[N]
any pirate scraped off a boat's hull,[AN]
but they love acting high and mighty.[N]
What they do in the name of freedom[Beat][N]
They're far more dangerous, in my eye.[AN]
[Left][2LB]
[Beat]Desiderio, you-[AN]
[FarFarRight]
Cap'n! There's a real big ship comin'[N]
starboard, with white sails![AN]
[Right]
Sounds like Ximo spotted something.[AN]
You all can continue your debate later,[N]
but first, let's greet our guests.[AN]
Razvan, go wake that oaf of a noble.[N]
Pilar, Desiderio, with me![AN]
[FarRight]
On it, Captain Lua![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[FarLeft]
Aye aye, captain![A]
[Left]
Let's see who awaits, shall we?[A][X]


## Ch1BeginningScene2
[FarLeft][LoadDesiderio]
[Left][LoadXimo]
[Right][LoadLua]
[FarRight][LoadPilar]
[Right]
Alright, Ximo.[AN]
How did it get so close[N]
before you notified us?[AN]
[Left]
The skies were all clear, I swear![AN]
My eyes closed for a second,[N]
and then, when I opened 'em,[AN]
that big ol' ship showed up[N]
way off on the horizon.[AN]
By the time I climbed down the[N]
lookout post, this happened![AN]
[Right]
Then move faster next time,[N]
fool! What do you think, Pilar?[AN]
How much longer until we pass by?[AN]
[FarRight]
A few minutes, at most.[N]
Are you planning to board?[AN]
[FarLeft]
What kind of question is that?[AN]
A ship that wide smells of a merchant,[N]
with plenty of loot for the taking.[AN]
We'd be fools to let it slip away![AN]
[FarRight]
Fools, perhaps, but alive ones.[AN]
There may be no one on the deck,[N]
but that doesn't preclude a trap.[AN]
[Right]
I see your point, Pilar. Still,[N]
the crew has a right to plunder.[AN]
If they have a trap lying in wait,[N]
we'll spring it and take the spoils![AN]
Desiderio, ready the grappling hooks[N]
so that they can't escape our reach.[AN]
Pilar, Ximo, prepare the boarding planks![A][X]

## Ch1BeginningScene3
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
Hm[Beat] No reaction yet, huh?[N]
Maybe it really is a merchant ship.[AN]
Razvan should be back with Carmen[N]
soon enough. When he arrives,[AN]
we'll search the ship, loot it,[N]
and sail it back to Port Greagor![AN]
[FarFarRight]
Bahahaha! Did you think[N]
it'd be that easy, curs?![A][X]

## Ch1BeginningScene4
[MidRight][LoadKhazhak]
[MidLeft][LoadLua]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Well, with that ugly mug,[N]
you're certainly no merchant.[AN]
What flag do you usually fly?[AN]
[MidRight]
Now, that's just mean! But your[N]
guess is right. The name's Khazhak,[N]
the finest Blackheart you'll ever see![AN]
[Beat]Except the boss, mind.[N]
Anyhow, it seems my plan was[N]
a complete success, after all.[AN]
Fools like you see a merchant's[N]
ship and think it an easy target,[N]
until me and my fellows show up.[AN]
It's the perfect ploy, bahahaha![N]
Now, care to make this easy for us,[N]
or do you want a rougher welcome?[AN]
[MidLeft][2LB]
[Beat]A Blackheart? Well, that's convenient.[AN]
I've been hoping to blow off some steam,[N]
and the dregs of the outer isles show up.[AN]
I won't surrender, least of all to you![AN]
[MidRight]
Heh[Beat] Fine, have it your way, then.[N]
Boys, come on out! It's a brawl![AN]
The first to take that captain's[N]
head gets double the spoils![A][X]

## Ch1BeginningScene5
[FarLeft][LoadXimo]
[Left][LoadCarmen]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[MidRight][3LB]
I see the noble lady's finally[N]
decided to grace us with her[N]
presence. Ready to fight, Carmen?[AN]
[Left][2LB]
Well, how I was to know enemies[N]
would arrive during my nap?[AN]
But yes, I have my tome,[N]
and my violin, and my voi-[AN]
[FarLeft]
Don't use that last part,[N]
Carmen. At least not on us.[AN]
[Left][3LB]
Perhaps your ears are untrained[N]
from years of living in the sticks,[N]
but there is a limit to my understanding.[AN]
That you would slander the melodious[N]
pitch of Carmen del Rias, songstress[N]
and musician, is unthinkable![AN]
[FarLeft]
Melodious? Does that mean outta tune?[N]
Never heard that word before,[N]
or half the ones from your mouth.[AN]
[MidRight]
Save your squabbling for later, brats.[N]
Neither of you are worth much in a fight,[N]
but you're better than nothing, at least.[AN]
Stay behind me and Desiderio,[N]
and take advantage of your strengths.[AN]
[FarLeft][2LB]
Aye aye, cap'n! Give me some room,[N]
and I can shoot at anything![AN]
Er[Beat] decently, anyway.[AN]
[Left]
My music should speed along our[N]
victory, so long as you all listen.[AN]
Failing that, this tome should suffice.[AN]
[MidRight]
Good. You're both green, but I have high[N]
expectations for you in the future.[AN]
Don't die in a place like this![A][X]

## Ch1BeginningScene6
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[MidLeft][LoadRazvan]
[MidLeft][3LB]
I see we can't avoid a fight, then.[N]
What dastardly pirates, disguising[N]
themselves with that sort of ship![AN]
[MidRight]
Not just any pirates, Razvan.[N]
Blackhearts. Care to get some[N]
revenge for your last encounter?[AN]
[MidLeft]
No, I have no need for revenge.[N]
But if they want to attack us,[N]
then let me provide healing.[AN]
I won't let them hurt you, captain![N]
Just don't act too recklessly[Beat][AN]
[MidRight][2LB]
Heh[Beat] You're a good lad, Razvan,[N]
but I could say the same to you.[AN]
You've got a habit of getting too close.[N]
Hide behind me if things get dicey, aye?[A]
[MidLeft][1LB]
Of course, Captain Lua![A][X]

## Ch1BeginningScene7
[FarLeft][LoadDesiderio]
[Left][LoadPilar]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
That just leaves you two,[N]
but you already know the score.[AN]
They've got their weapons raised,[N]
so we'd better return the favor.[AN]
Desiderio, take the front with me.[N]
Pilar, fight wherever you wish.[AN]
[Left]
If scum like them are our target,[N]
then I won't feel any sympathy.[A]
[FarLeft]
Ah[Beat] the sweet, sweet, smell of loot.[N]
I'll be earning back my losses, captain![AN]
[MidRight]
So long as you don't get too greedy,[N]
do as you please. Follow my lead![A][X]

## Ch1EndingScene1
[MidLeft][LoadKhazhak]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[MidLeft]
Heh[Beat] So this is how it ends[Beat][N]
What are you waiting for, woman?[AN]
With these wounds, not even a healer[N]
can mend them[Beat] I'm as good as dead.[AN]
Do me a favor and finish the job.[AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
I've heard and seen enough to know that[N]
Blackhearts show no mercy themselves,[N]
so why should I show any to you?[AN]
Before you bleed out, humor me.[N]
Why did you join such a vile band?[AN]
What possible reason could you have?[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat]Out in these isles, there's only[N]
one law, no matter how much people[N]
like you try to act the judge.[AN]
The strong survive, and the weak die.[AN]
I swore an oath to Captain Alonso[N]
because I was weak[Beat] An oath to[N]
serve a crew, and not just myself.[AN]
Every Blackheart remembers these words:[N]
Deceive before we can be deceived.[AN]
Take before we can be taken from.[AN]
Kill before we can be killed![AN]
[MidRight][1LB]
[Beat]Your captain sounds like a maniac.[AN]
[MidLeft][3LB]
Maybe he is[Beat] but he's ours,[N]
and the reason we weaklings survived.[AN]
And when he hears about today,[N]
that maniac will hunt you[N]
as far as the skies reach.[AN]
Ba[Beat] Bahahaha! You won't[Beat] escape[Beat][AN][CloseEyes][X]

## Ch1EndingScene2
[MidRight][LoadLua]
[Beat]Let him try it, then.[N]
You'll see him soon, Khazhak.[AN]
[FarLeft][LoadDesiderio]
[Left][LoadPilar]
[FarLeft]
Bad news, boss! There's nothing,[N]
not so much as a small bullion![AN]
[MidRight][3LB]
Not surprising. Whenever they hijacked[N]
this ship, they must have cleared it out[N]
before using it for this cheap trick.[AN]
Well, it's not all for naught.[N]
The ship itself is a nice prize, no?[AN]
We can sell it when we reach port,[N]
so I'll have you two take it there.[AN]
[Left][2LB]
Very well. We should fly close,[N]
in case another problem occurs.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Leave it to me, boss.[N]
So long as I get an extra cut[Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
To make up for today's losses, yes?[AN]
Don't worry, I'll grant you both[N]
an extra bullion when it sells.[AN]
[FarLeft]
Ha, this is why you're the best![AN]
Come on, Pilar. Let's get to it![A][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[Left]
Too spirited, as always[Beat][N]
We'll follow your lead, Lua.[A][X]

## Ch1EndingScene3
[MidLeft][LoadRazvan]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
Razvan, you're still here?[AN]
We're resuming our route soon,[N]
so best to get below deck.[AN]
The Liberator moves quick,[N]
and I don't want you falling off.[AN]
[MidLeft]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MidRight]
[Beat]Shaken up, are you?[AN]
This is your first real battle[N]
with us, so I expected as much.[AN]
[MidLeft]
I just[Beat] Even though I hate these men,[N]
and by all accounts, they deserve this,[AN]
when I look at their[Beat] their bodies,[N]
I can't help but feel my stomach turn.[AN]
I knew that pirating came with violence,[N]
but seeing it firsthand is different.[AN]
[MidRight]
If it ever gets too much to bear,[N]
you can leave at any time, Razvan.[AN]
You've more than repaid your debt.[AN]
[MidLeft]
That's kind of you to say,[N]
but the truth is, I haven't.[AN]
Even today, you all protected me[N]
more than my healing was worth.[AN]
And besides that, if I'm to become[N]
a healer that honors my teacher,[AN]
I have to get used to this.[AN]
I'm here to stay, Captain Lua,[N]
so don't try to chase me away![AN]
[MidRight]
Ha[Beat] You're one stubborn brat.[N]
Do as you like, then.[AN]
We'll arrive at Port Greagor soon,[N]
so take that opportunity to relax.[AN]
[MidLeft]
O-Of course, captain![AN]
I won't disappoint you[N]
with my ability to relax![AN][CloseSpeechSlow][ClearFace]
[MidRight]
No, that's[Beat] Bah, forget it.[N]
The kid's too earnest for his own good.[AN]
[Beat]I'd better get this thing headed[N]
to port before Desiderio has a fit.[AN]
This journey took a lot out of me[Beat][N]
We can't reach home soon enough.[A][X]


## Ch1KhazhakWarning
[MidLeft][LoadKhazhak]
Blast, this whole plan's gone sideways![AN]
If word gets out, our bad name'll all[N]
go to waste with how they've thrashed us![AN]
I'll wait, but if this goes on any longer,[N]
we'll have to make a mad dash at them![A][X]

## Ch1KhazhakCharges
[MidLeft][LoadKhazhak][3LB]
Well, it's as the captain always says:[N]
[OQ]If you want something done right,[N]
do it yourself after all else fails![CQ][AN]
For any of you lot still alive, listen up![AN]
If we run away, Captain Alonso'll have[N]
our heads, but if we just sit here,[N]
so will those dastards over there.[AN]
All we can do is charge til they drop,[N]
or we do! May the worst man win![A][X]

## Ch1ThiefArrival
[MidLeft][LoadLua][3LB]
Looks like one of their goons has a mind[N]
to take advantage of the confusion[N]
and take whatever's in that chest[Beat][AN]
Well, big mistake. That's our loot, now![N]
Hunt him down before he gets away![A][X]
