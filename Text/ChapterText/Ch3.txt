[ML]
Lua. How goes the planning?[AN]
[MR][3LB]
As well as it can, I suppose.[AN]
The crew's grown fairly large,[N]
so there's a lot more paperwork[N]
to deal with and loot to dole out.[AN]
Desiderio's handling the lion's share[N]
of it, but that still leaves all this.[AN]
[ML]
Mm[Beat] My condolences. Anyway,[N]
I came here to give you a report.[AN]
So far, the journey's been smooth.[AN]
But the weather indicates a storm[N]
is coming for us within the hour.[AN]
Our ships are well-equipped for it,[N]
thanks to Rahel and her carpentry,[N]
but we still need to be vigilant.[AN]
[MR]
Thanks, Pilar. Hm[Beat] I should've[N]
known that flying into the Old World[N]
wouldn't be so easy, but still[Beat][AN]
[ML]
It is as you say; the primary reason[N]
the Old World is ill-known comes[N]
from the numerous storms around it.[AN]
Truthfully, the one coming towards[N]
us appears relatively mild for the[N]
region. Certainly not a tempest.[AN]
[MR][2LB]
Then I guess I can't complain, huh?[AN]
We can handle it. If we couldn't,[N]
then you'd have warned us off, right?[AN]
[ML]
Of course. The problem lies in what[N]
comes after we make it through, Lua.[AN]
[MR]
What do you mean by that?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]You'll see soon enough.[AN]

[L]
C-Captain Lua, there's big trouble![N]
We have to get out of here, now![AN]
[FR]
Calm down, Rahel.[N]
What's the situation?[AN]
[FL][3LB]
Just a few friends behind us, is all.[N]
Ones bearing T.O.R.C.H. flags.[AN]
I hoped that all of our misadventures[N]
in the outskirts threw them off our tail,[N]
but it seems that was wishful thinking.[AN]
[FR][2LB]
When you say few, how many?[AN]
[L]
There was one really big ship,[N]
and about four smaller ones.[AN]
They definitely outnumber us.[AN]
[FR]
They did at Port Greagor too,[N]
but we all know what happened there.[AN]
That said, we're not on our own turf,[N]
so we won't have the advantage here.[AN]
[FL]
Continuing to flee is still an option,[N]
one that I would personally recommend.[AN]
I am a merchant at heart, not a fighter.[AN]
[R]
Turning our backs to them only allows[N]
them to chase us into the Old World.[AN]
Lua, I recommend that we use the storm[N]
to our advantage and take them out.[AN]
[FR][ToggleSmile]
Good, at least someone's got some moxie.[N]
I was thinking the same thing, Pilar.[AN]
With a storm comes rain and thunder,[AN]
so let's make use of that to hide[N]
our movements and surround them.[AN]
Then, all we have to do is take their[N]
commander's head, and we'll win.[A]
[R][ToggleSmile]
That is[Beat] a rather bold plan,[AN]
but it works. I can helm one ship[N]
and bring whoever to accompany me.[AN]
[FR][3LB]
Good. Orlando, I'd ask you to take[N]
the other ship, but you'd probably[N]
run off with it when I'm not looking.[AN]
[FL]
Ah, such a harsh rebuke, Lua![AN]
Do you truly think I would abandon[N]
you all in your time of need?[N]
[Beat]Actually, you don't need to answer.[AN]
I suspect it'll only hurt my feelings.[A]
[FR]
[Beat]More importantly, Desiderio's got[N]
more respect from the others than you.[AN]
His boatsmanship could still use work,[N]
but it's good enough for this job.[AN]
Pilar, pass on these instructions to him,[N]
will you? We'll need his strength. And[Beat][N]
Tell Desiderio that I'm counting on him.[AN]
[R]
[Beat]Heh, of course.[N]
Good luck, Lua,[N]
and may we meet again.[A][X]

[FR][3LB]
And for the rest of you[Beat][N]
I'll decide on the groups in advance[N]
that'll support each squad leader.[AN]
This'll likely be our hardest battle yet,[N]
so I don't want to hear any complaining.[AN]
[L]
Hey, what are you looking at me for?![AN]
I'm a pirate now, so the captain's word[N]
is absolute. I won't let you down, got it?[AN]
[FL]
Well, you really took to it fast, Rahel.[N]
As for me[Beat] I would rather not die,[N]
so I suppose I can listen to you, Lua.[AN]
[FR]
Good, I'm counting on you two,[N]
and everyone else in the crew.[N]
[Beat]Now, how do I tell Razvan?[A][X]

//dalila and alonso talk and then realize they are being surrounded

## Ch3BeginningScene2
[MidLeft][LoadDalila]
[MidRight][LoadAlonso]
[ML]
What do you want, Alonso?[N]
I'm a little busy right now.[AN]
[MR]
Does a captain need a reason[N]
to chat with his first mate?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, but you always have one.[AN]
Just make it quick, alright?[AN]
[MR]
Cold as always, eh Dalila?[AN]
Fine, fine, I won't waste your time.[N]
How's that Scorpio comin' along?[AN]
[ML]
The basic setup is finished.[AN]
It'll shoot any flier out of the sky,[N]
and hurts everybody else just fine.[AN]
Could use some more fine tuning,[N]
but it'll do its job well enough.[AN]
[MR]
Glad to hear it. Somethin' tells me[N]
we'll be needin' it sooner than later.[AN]
We can't rely on T.O.R.C.H. to get the[N]
job done, not the way we want it done.[AN]
[ML]
That's why we never should've joined[N]
T.O.R.C.H. and listened to their rules.[AN]
Weren't you always the one who said that[N]
anyone who crossed us would get theirs?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Are you doubtin' my decision, Dalila?[N]
Do you think you'd have chose better?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat] [Beat][AN]
[MR]
Good. You're the only one who's got the[N]
stones to give me a piece of their mind.[AN]
I can't have you goin' soft on me,[N]
not before we finish the job[N]
and get back to our old ways.[AN]
[ML]
Huh? But[Beat] you signed us up to be[N]
privateers. Government lapdogs.[AN]
What's with the change of heart?[A]
[MR]
I did that because we didn't have[N]
the power to hunt Lua's crew ourselves.[AN]
Would you have had me look the other way,[N]
when we can't even give Khazhak a burial?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, I wouldn't. But even so,[N]
I can't see any way back to the old days.[AN]
If we betray Incendivis's government now,[AN]
the T.O.R.C.H. rats that are watching[N]
our every move won't let us off lightly.[AN]
[MR]
Mm. And even if we kill those bastards,[N]
they won't stop hunting us after that.[AN]
The freedom we prided ourselves in[N]
is nothin' more than a mirage[Beat][AN]
That's what you're thinkin', right?[AN]
But I wouldn't have signed that contract[N]
if I couldn't think of a way out of it.[AN]
Have I ever steered us wrong before?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]No, you haven't.[AN]
[MR]
That's right, and I'm not startin' now.[AN]
The first problem is all these T.O.R.C.H.[N]
on my boat[Beat][A] but we've got a friend[N]
comin' who'll fix that, any second now.[AN]
[ML]
You don't mean[Beat] Lua?[AN]
[MR]
The enemy of my enemy isn't my friend,[N]
but she's a nice pawn on the board.[AN]
One that ain't gonna wait for us[N]
to chase her, if my guess is right.[AN]
Follow my orders, and we'll make it[N]
through this, just like always.[AN]
[Beat]Do you trust me, Dalila?[AN]
[ML]
[Beat]My belief in you hasn't changed,[N]
not once since we first met.[AN]
You can rely on me, Alonso.[N]
Let's win back our freedom![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_1
[MidLeft][LoadAlonso]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
We've got you surrounded,[N]
so don't try flying away.[AN]
Who the hell are you?[N]
You're no T.O.R.C.H. officer.[AN]
[ML]
The name's Alonso, and I'm the cap'n[N]
of the Blackhearts.[A] Maybe you remember[N]
a man named Khazhak? Had a heart tattoo?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]Can't say it rings a bell.[AN]
[ML]
You're a real terrible liar, woman.[N]
I know you killed 'im, so drop the act.[AN]
[MR]
If you want to blame anyone, blame him.[N]
He tried to ambush us and paid for it[N]
with his life, like anyone else would.[AN]
[ML]
Look, I don't care if what[N]
you did was right or wrong.[AN]
But you killed one of my men.[AN]
And for that, I'm not lettin' any[N]
of you walk away with your heads.[AN]
[MR][3LB]
Ha[Beat] hahaha! Sorry, it's just hard[N]
to take you seriously when you're[N]
leading the scummiest crew around.[AN]
[ML]
Keep laughin', but I know what I am,[N]
and I've got no problem admittin' it.[AN]
Lootin', ransom, murder, you name it,[N]
I've done it with a smile on my face.[AN]
But some pirates, like you lot,[N]
get real uppity about morals[N]
when we're all bilge in the end.[AN]
If you want something, take it.[N]
If you hate someone, kill them.[N]
Ain't that the way life should be?[AN]
[MR]
[Beat]We're criminals, not monsters.[N]
Any target of mine deserves their dues,[N]
and everyone else is off limits.[AN]
That's how I've always lived my life,[N]
even before I became a pirate,[N]
and I'm not changing that now.[AN]
For all the crimes you've committed[Beat][N]
I'll be the one to pass your sentence.[N]
Don't expect any clemency from me![A]
[ML][ToggleSmile]
Gahahaha! You've got some moxie, woman.[N]
I like that. Let's stop yappin', then,[N]
and get to killin' each other already.[AN]
[Beat]Just don't die before you reach me,[N]
after all that talk of yours, "hero"![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_2
[MidLeft][LoadRazvan]
[MidRight][LoadLua]
W-What are those platforms, captain?
They're linking all of the ships![A]
[MR][3LB]
Looks like they're hovering the same[N]
way that airships do, but I've never[N]
seen anything like it before.[AN]
Must be some kind of T.O.R.C.H. tech[N]
that Alonso got by bending the knee.[AN]
We won't be able to retreat until we[N]
can undo these links, since they're[N]
freezing all of our ships in place.[AN]
[ML]
Right. I'd bet that Alonso has some[N]
sort of key to undeploy this device,[N]
but it won't be easy to reach him.[AN]
And[Beat] if we take too long, Elodia[N]
may show up as well. That would be[Beat][AN]
[MR]
Our doom. We're sitting ducks like this,[N]
and I'd bet any remaining forces that[N]
T.O.R.C.H. has will be too much for us.[AN]
We can't take too long, and we can't rush[N]
either, with how entrenched Alonso is[Beat][N]
This'll be our hardest battle yet.[AN]
All crew, make for the center boat![N]
Let's take the Blackhearts down,[N]
once and for all. Follow my lead![A]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_3Razvan
[ML][LoadRazvan]
Yes, captain! I'll do my best to[N]
answer your faith in me, I swear it![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_3Pilar
[ML][LoadPilar]
Move carefully, everyone.[AN]
We're almost to our destination,[N]
so fight and survive another day![A][X]

## Ch3BeginningScene3_3Desiderio
[ML][LoadDesiderio]
Alonso? I knew that was the name of the[N]
Blackhearts captain, but to think[Beat][AN]
Hasn't changed a bit since he was[N]
a Roseblade. He's still a bastard[N]
who gives all us pirates a bad name.[AN]
I'll do what my old captain couldn't[N]
and put him down, here and now![A][X]

## Ch3MidMapAlonsoWarning
[ML][LoadAlonso]
Elodia should be here any minute now[Beat][N]
Takin' her long enough, but we just[N]
gotta hold out a bit longer, fellas![AN]
Don't let Lua take another damn step![A][X]

//end event: Alonso is defeated, and Dalila is on the verge of death.
//Lua interrogates him briefly, but he is noncompliant, enraged at what Lua's done.
//He buys just enough time for Elodia's ship to arrive, and before he does so,
//he activates the explosives on the bridges and spites Lua with that knowledge before
//throwing a smoke bomb and leaping off one of the bridges.
//The crew initially panics, but Lua tells them all to get back to the main ship
//and try to saw off the bridges. They succeed, but the explosives activate and damage
//the engine. Forced to prepare for a crash landing, Pilar takes over the steering
//and tells Lua that she knows an island not far from here, that they can reach if they're lucky
//before the engine shuts down. Lua is surprised, but immediately relents and orders Razvan
//to heal the wounded while Desiderio helps her keep the engine going long enough to make it.

//They reach the island, but the engine shuts down just as they're going down to land.
//Lua orders everyone to get below deck and prepare for the crash, praying that they'll all survive!
